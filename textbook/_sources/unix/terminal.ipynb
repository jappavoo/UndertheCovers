It turns out that the simplicity of an ASCII terminal and the ASCII oriented programming tools of UNIX continue to power much of the digital world around us.  [LINUX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) and other versions of UNIX runs on every imaginable device today all the way from supercomputers to watches. And at some point or another a programmer used terminal sessions communicating with the UNIX running on those devices to develop and debug the layers of software that most people never see but rely on to make those devices useful.  \n",

Microsoft's Windows OS is not a UNIX operating systems but includes a similar program called [Windows Terminal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/).  Unlike the old days since there is really no physical terminal device a single user can start as many terminal sessions each within its own window as one likes.  As we will see later it is very useful to use multiple terminal sessions to organize your work.  Additionally, both OSX and Windows provides a program called [SSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell_Protocol).   SSH allows you to use a terminal emulator running on your computer to connect to remote computers.  Doing so is like connecting a terminal device to the remote computers you are connect to.  The following discusses using ssh on windows [Windows Terminal SSH](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/tutorials/ssh) and the one to using ssh on OS [OSX Terminal SSH](https://osxdaily.com/2017/04/28/howto-ssh-client-mac/).  \n",

This server will automatically start the Jupyter environment which will serve the book's content to your web-browser.  This software, allows you to read and interact with the source material for chapters of the book and also allows you to create terminal sessions so that you can directly use the UNIX development tools installed on the computer via the xterm.js terminal emulators.  This allows you the freedom to explore all the topics and material from within your web-browser.  But please note there is nothing special about these terminals or the Linux system.
