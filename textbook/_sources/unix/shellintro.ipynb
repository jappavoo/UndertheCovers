The primary responsibility of the kernel is to provide utilities that simplify the writing and running of application/user programs. This is where the shell comes in. The shell acts as our primary point of contact/interface, not only to the kernel, but also to all other installed programs.\n",

The kernel functions that a process can request are called \"system calls\". In the next part of this book, we will look in more detail at how a process can issue a request for the kernel to execute a system call.  For the moment, it is sufficient to know that each system call, which we identify by names, can only be requested by an already running program. When a process makes a request to execute a system call, it can pass arguments to the system call. Similarly, on completion of the system call the kernel can return values back to the process. Operating system kernels can provide hundreds of system calls. In the diagram above, the white labeled boxes within the kernel oval illustrate a small subset of important UNIX kernel system calls. \n",

In other words, a shell has been built to let a human make use of the Operating System kernel, which itself has been written to help us make use of the computer hardware.  It does this by: 1) accepting human oriented commands from a user, 2) executing kernel system calls to get the work of the commands done, and 3) sending a response back.  The shell includes the ability to locate other executable programs and launch new processes from them.    \n",

These interfaces allow us to find and launch programs, open files, and navigate the computer to do our daily work.  The primary goal of such interfaces is ease of use.  The shell, however, is text based, and is designed with programmers in mind.  Specifically, its syntax and commands are designed in such a way that they form an \"extensible\" programming language.  Here, extensible refers to the ability for users to add to and extend it with ease. This language allows a human user to not only use the facilities of the kernel, but also to automate their daily tasks, and efficiently conduct the various forms of data processing programmers often do.

For every new terminal connection, software directs the kernel to start an instance of a shell program to interact with a user at that terminal.

    "The way we interact with the shell can be thought of as a structured, interactive, \"conversation\". The conversation is a series of back and forth exchanges. We, the user, type in a request in the form of a \"command line\". In response, the shell takes some actions, and generates a particular response, as byte values, which are sent back to the terminal.  The terminal translates the response byte values into ASCII characters, displaying/printing the appropriate images of the ascii characters to the screen for the user to read.   \n",

    "\n",
    "Given our use of ASCII encoding, the definition of a \"line\", in Unix, is very precise. It is a series of byte values terminated by a single 'new-line/line-feed' value.  Using an ASCII  table, we see that the byte value for the new-line character is `0b10000010` in binary, or expressed more concisely in hex as `0xA`. The common shorthand notation for the newline byte value is `\\n`.  Pressing the *return*  or *enter* key, depending on your keyboard, within a terminal window will generate this value.   We will simply refer to the key that generates a '\\n' as the *enter* key.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When `\\n` is received by the shell, it will begin working on processing the line as a command.  In this way, we say the shell is \"line oriented\".  If the user presses `\\n` with no other preceding characters, it is considered a blank or empty line.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In the other direction, the terminal emulator is configured to take the appropriate action when it receives a `\\n`.  That is to say, it moves the cursor to the next lower position in the window (scrolling if configured to do so) and moves it to the left edge of the new line (again, scrolling the window if configured to do so).\n",
    "\n",
    "```{tip}\n",
    "There are two basic modes that the UNIX kernel can use when delivering bytes sent from the terminal connection to the program running on the connection; character and line. In character mode, the bytes of data from the terminal are sent along to the running program as soon as they are received, including the `\\n`.  In line (or buffered) mode, the kernel stores up the characters to be sent until a `\\n` is received, at which point it sends the complete line with the `\\n` to the running program. Line mode is typically the default. In the context of our discussion of the shell, this mode setting is not very relevant, as the shell's behavior is largely unchanged by this setting. Since the shell is a line-oriented program, it is designed to process whole lines at a time - regardless of whether the line was received in its entirety, or character by character. However, it is good to keep this distinction in mind to avoid confusion when we are writing programs that are not line-oriented, and therefore expect to receive characters as soon as the keys are pressed by the user.  \n",

The prompt is a configurable sequence of characters, beginning on a new line, indicating to us that the shell is ready to recieve a line. When a new connection is established, it sends the prompt to the terminal so that we know that it is ready for the session/conversation to begin.  The classic prompt string is often either the dollar symbol, `$` or greater than sign `>` followed by a single space character.

This includes the `\\n` that the user presses to indicate the end of the command line.

Note, things might get confusing quickly if you turn echo off.  But Unix is all about understanding how things work, and taking advantage of the power to control them.  If you want to know more, try `man stty` - but be warned, you will find that communicating via a terminal is actually quite a bit more complex than it might seem.

    "When the shell receives a command line, it goes through a series of steps to process it.  The rules of this processing define what is called the [Shell Grammar](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/bash.1.html#SHELL_GRAMMAR).  The Shell Grammar and builtin commands form an entire programming language.  Programs written in this language are called Shell Scripts, and are used extensively to automate all sorts of tasks.  Over the years, one learns more and more subtle aspects of the shell grammar and its usage. While it is possible to use the shell without knowing its underlying grammar, having a working knowledge can really help in understanding why the shell behaves the way it does, and in demystifying its somewhat strange syntax.\n",

    "\n",
    "There are two ways in which we can use the shell: interactively or non-interactively. In either case, the core operation of the shell is unchanged -- processing command lines.  The difference lies in the source of the commands processed by the shell. In the interactive mode, the commands are coming from a human through a terminal connection. In non-interactive mode, rather than a human typing the command lines at a terminal, the commands are read from a file. In the interactive case, after each command line is executed the shell sends the prompt to the human and waits for them to send the next command line.  In non-interactive mode, the command lines are being read from a shell script file.  A shell script is simply a file containing several shell command lines. In this mode, the command lines in the file are immediately executed one after the other, bypassing the need for the shell to prompt or wait.   \n",

    "### Step 1: Breaking down a \"Command line\" into Simple Commands and Arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "In this step, the shell splits the command line into a set of tokens that form \"simple commands\".   Several simple commands can make up a single command line. The common boundary that separates tokens are \"blanks\".  Blanks are `space` and `tab` characters ([blanks](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/bash.1.html#DEFINITIONS)).   In the ASCII code, space characters are encoded with a byte value of `0x20` and a tab is encoded by `0x09`.  So, a sequence of one more of these two characters will cause the shell to split what is before the sequence and what is after the sequence into two separate tokens.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<a id=\"meta_def\"></a>\n",
    "In addition to the blank `space` and `tab` characters, the following characters `|  & ; ( ) < > newline` will also indicate the separation of tokens.  Together, these characters are known as the shell \"metacharacters\".  In time, we will learn about how these characters affect the commands to be executed. Some will let us combine simple commands in various ways, while others will affect how the command is executed.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Command versus Arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "The first token of simple command is the name of the command to execute.  The following tokens in the set will be passed to the command as arguments.  To know where the arguments of a particular simple command end, the shell looks for one of the following \"control\" operators.  Notice that some of the metacharacters, `| & ; ( )` and `newline` itself both separate tokens and terminate the tokens of simple command.  Using the control characters allows us to chain independent simple commands together. "

Still, even throughout our interactive use of the shell we will find them to be a helpful tool (see [Command line history](#history)).\n",

Two spaces then separate `hello` from `goodbye`.  Then, the sequence of space, tab, space separate `goodbye` from `me`.  A single space seperates `me` from `again`.  `again` is terminated as a token by the following space, tab and newline.

    "\n",
    "- Priority: **Important to know basics** - the rest can wait till later\n",
    "- Synopsis: Like  programming languages, the shell supports the notion of a variable that is identified by a \"name\" and has a \"value\".  Shell variables are actually a special case, and a subset of a what are called \"shell parameters\". We will focus specifically on variables for now. The shell provides certain, special, built-in variables such as \"RANDOM\" - whose value expands to a random number. Later, we will come to know and utilize another very important built-in - the \"PATH\" variable.  There are several ways that we can introduce our own variables, and assign them a value.  The simplest is a command line of the form:  `name=value`.   During Parameter Expansion, the `$` followed by name, will trigger parameter expansion (optionally, the name can be enclosed in braces `{name}`).  The token will then be expanded to the value if the named variable exists. Otherwise the token will be simply removed.  The shell provides all kinds of fancy ways of manipulating and transforming the value of a variable during expansions, such as deleting or substituting portions, but we will leave that for later.  Finally, shell variables can have attributes associated with them.   One important attribute marks a variable as exported.  We will see later that exported variables are passed to new programs as part of their initial \"environment\".  \n",

The way a pattern is stated, and the way it is matched, can get quite subtle and complex. The basic use, however, is easy, and can be a huge time saver.   After the preceding expansions are done and the second round of word splitting is complete, the shell will scan what remains, looking for a special set of characters it recognizes as pattern characters.  The most useful of these is the star `*`. The star will be substituted for any sequence of characters.  As such, it is often called the \"wildcard character\", since it matches anything.  The shell will then look to see if there are files or directories that match the token, substituting the patterns as necessary.  If matching names exist, then it will replace the single token with any matches found.

    "### Step 3: Parse Redirections\n",
    "\n",
    "To fully understand what it means to parse redirections, we must have a more complete understanding of how commands are run, and of the UNIX I/O model -- how a program can conduct input and output.   This understanding will take us a little time, as it involves concepts such as Processes, Streams and Files, and how they interrelate.  At this point, we take a simple view that we will build upon in time.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Processes\n",
    "\n",
    "As we proceed, our understanding of what a process is will become more and more advanced.  For the moment, our simple working definition will be defined as any running program on a system (excluding the kernel).   The shell we interact with is a process, and the commands that we run from the shell run either within the shell process, or as new processes.   We will look at this distinction in more detail when we discuss internal built-in versus external commands.   Regardless, the commands we issue run as a process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Parse Redirections step is all about controlling the source and destination of a process's input and output.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Streams: Standard Input, Output and Error\n",
    "\n",
    "UNIX provides three default \"streams\" that a process can use for its input and output.  The default streams are called: Standard Input, Standard Output and Standard Error.  A process can ignore these if it wants - but most commands, by default, use these streams.  A stream is a connection to a source or destination for reading or writing bytes.  A process reads bytes from a stream via `read` calls to the kernel. Such a stream is an input stream.  Similarly, a stream that a process can write bytes to, via `write`  kernel calls, is an output stream.  As implied by the name, a stream is like a \"flow\" of bytes.  Reading bytes from an input stream successively gets bytes from the source it is connected to. Writing bytes to a stream successively sends more and more bytes to the connected destination.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ASCII streams\n",
    "\n",
    "What the bytes \"mean\" or what will be done with them is up to the process. Most of the daily UNIX commands we use assume ASCII line oriented data.  This means that most commands expect that the bytes they read from their standard input will be bytes that encode ASCII lines of data.  Similarly we can expect most commands to write ASCII lines of data to their standard output and error streams.  \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Standard Error\n",
    "\n",
    "The UNIX designers knew that it is very common to have commands produce \"normal\" output and \"error\" output.  To support this separation, they decided to make it standard that processes get both a standard output, and an error stream.  \n",
    "\n",
    "By convention, when a developer is creating UNIX commands, they write them to send their \"normal\" output to the standard out stream.   When the programmer of a command wants to send error messages or warning messages, they use the standard error stream.  This allows someone using a command to easily direct normal output to one destination, and error output to another.   Eg. they might decide they want to ignore and hide all warning messages by redirecting the error stream to a different destination.   While, for the most part, we don't normally use this extra flexibility, there are times when it proves very handy.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Streams and Files\n",
    "\n",
    "But, where exactly do the bytes for a stream come from, or go to?\n",
    "A common phrase that you may hear is that in UNIX everything is a file.  From this perspective, streams are connections to files that allow a command to read or write the data of the file.   \n",
    "\n",
    "The designers of UNIX decided that they would try and represent all locations that might serve as a source or destination of data as files.  This includes even devices - such as terminals.  To this end, the UNIX kernel represents the majority of the devices of a computer as files that a stream can be connected to.   Reading from an input stream connected to a device \"file\" gets data from that device.  Writing to an output stream connected to a device file sends data to the device.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Opening streams and File Descriptors\n",
    "\n",
    "To connect a stream, a program makes an \"open\" kernel call.  As part of the open call, the program passes the path name of the file to connect the stream to, and also specifies if the connection is for input or output (or both).  If successful, the kernel will establish the connection.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For every process, or running program, the kernel maintains a table of open streams. This table is called a file descriptor table.  Each entry in the table is either empty or not empty.  If empty, the entry does not hold a description of an open stream.  If it is not empty, then it contains the information that describes an open stream.  The kernel can then use this descriptor information to operate on the stream, eg. read or write bytes to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "When an open call is made, the kernel scans the table for the next empty location and stores the descriptor information about the newly opened stream into that location.  The index of this newly populated table entry is returned back to the process.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Historically, these indexes are themselves called **File Descriptor** numbers.  All of the kernel operations on a stream - such as read and write - require a file descriptor so that the kernel knows what stream to operate on.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The first three  file descriptors; 0, 1, and 2 are where connections for standard input, output and error are expected to be. \n",
    "\n",
    "```{tip} \n",
    "The UNIX kernel also provides other operations that let a process control its file descriptors.  This includes the ability to close a file and mark a descriptor as empty via the `close` system call.  It also lets a process control its table of file descriptors via system calls such as `dup` and `dup2` that duplicate/copy table entries.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Terminals and Streams\n",
    "\n",
    "As we read, an ASCII terminal provides a natural way for humans to both receive and send ASCII, line-oriented data.  When we connect to a UNIX system via a new terminal, the kernel starts a shell for us, and connects its standard streams to the particular device file that represents our terminal.   When the shell writes bytes - such as the prompt - to its standard output, we see this output in the terminal that the shell is \"connected\" to.  Similarly, when we type characters into the terminal, the shell will receive them when it reads from its standard input.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Defaults\n",
    "\n",
    "When the shell runs a command, it establishes what the command's standard input, output, and error streams will be connected to.  The default behavior is to connect them to the same streams that the shell is connected to.  In most cases, this will be the terminal that the shell is interacting with.   For this reason, the input and output of a command, by default, come from and go to the terminal we are working within.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overriding the defaults\n",
    "\n",
    "Once steps 1 and 2 of command line processing have completed, the shell has identified one or more commands, along with arguments, that we want executed.   In addition to using commands and their arguments to control its behavior, the shell also gives us the ability to control where the input and output streams for a program might come from and go to.\n",
    "    \n",
    "As stated above, if we don't use any of the special redirection support, then the default behavior will be used.   If, however, we use the redirection syntax, then we can have the shell control what file descriptors a command will have open, and where they will be connected to before they run.  While there are many advanced uses of the redirection syntax, basic usage is straightforward.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "When discussing command line splitting, we introduced that `<` and `>` are <a href=\"#meta_def\">metacharacters</a>.  Their primary use is to specify redirections.  The greater than character,  `>`,  is used to control output stream redirection. Conversely, the less than, `<` character is used to control input stream redirection.\n",
    "  \n",
    "The following examples introduce the basics. See the references for details of the syntax and more advanced uses.\n",

    "##### External \"Shell Commands\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps one of the coolest things about the shell, and more generally UNIX, is the way everything is broken down into small building blocks.  Rather than building the majority of the UNIX commands into the shell, the designers choose to provide an easy way to automatically find and launch external programs.  As matter of fact, philosophically, the original idea was to keep the number of builtins as small as possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this way, the shell's scope of responsibility remains specific - to provide the syntax for interacting with a human user, and for launching additional commands as processes. Thus, the external programs that one adds to the system can each focus on adding a single new ability.  Eg. A program that lists the contents of a directory to its standard output (`ls`), a program that copies its standard input stream to its standard output stream (`cat`), a program that lists all the current processes (`ps`).  \n",
    "This \"separation of concerns\" not only allows for a great deal of flexibility in adding commands, it also means that one can have several different versions of shell programs. In this case, each shell version may provide its own take on the syntax, while maintaining the ability to reuse the existing commands.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This separation of concerns approach empowers and encourages programmers:\n",
    "- A programmer can easily grow the system by adding a new \"command\"\n",
    "- A programmer can tailor each new command for a given task.  \n",
    "- A programmer can easily override the default commands by installing their own programs (which are found before the standard ones)\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the years, the flexibility of this approach and the popularity of UNIX has lead to the development of a very large set of programs that one can add to the system and treat as commands.  Although they are often referred to as *\"Shell Commands\"* they are not really builtin to any given shell.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Today, when people talk about knowing UNIX commands, they are generally referring to a set of external programs that have evolved into a standard. The following Wikipedia page documents such a list."

    "##### Locating  External commands\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to have the shell run an external file as a program:\n",
    "1) by using the pathname of a file as the command\n",
    "2) by using the name of a file that is in one of the directories listed in the value of the PATH shell variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Commands as pathnames\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to execute an external command,  indicated by DECISION 1 on the flow chart, is to use the \"path\" name of the file we want to execute as a command.   Recall that [pathname](../unix/files.ipynb#pathname) of a file in UNIX is a name that uses `/`'s to indicate its name within the tree of existing directories and files.  DECISION 1 is really saying that if the command name of the command line is something that \"looks\" like a path name, then assume that it is.  In particular, ask the kernel to start a new process from the named file.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Absolute and Relative Paths\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id=\"sec:relativepaths\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the prior chapter, [Organizing and Managing Information](../unix/files.ipynb), we discussed how a file is named as a pathname starting at the Root (`/`) of the directory tree.   Such paths whose names begin with `/` are called absolute paths.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To ease the burden of naming files, UNIX also provides what are called relative paths.  Rather than starting a path name all the way from the root of the directory tree,  a path can be named relative.  As is discussed in the [Environment](#cwd) section, each process has associated with it a \"current working directory\".  We can think of this as a pointer to a specific directory in the directory tree.  When a process asks the kernel to open or lookup a path that does not start with a leading `/` the kernel will assume that the path is relative to the process's current working directory. \n",
    "\n",
    "When we start a new terminal session, the shell  process started has its current working directory initially set to our user's HOME directory.  Eg. For the jovyan user in our UNIX environment, it would be /home/jovyan.  The `pwd` command can be used to print what the shell's current working directory is, and the `cd` command can be used to change it to another directory.  \n",
    "\n",
    "So if we use `mydir/myfile` as a shell command, the shell will ask the kernel to locate an external command.  Given the lack of a leading `/`, the kernel will assume that we are looking for a file, `myfile` in a directory called `mydir` which is under the the shell process's current working directory.  If the working directory is `/home/jovyan`, then the full path of the file we are trying to locate would be `/home/jovyan/mydir/myfile`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice, however, if our current working directory was `/home/jovyan/mydir` and we wanted to have the shell execute, as an external, the file `myfile` by pathname, it would not work to simply type `myfile` as the command.  DECISION 1 explicitly states that in order to treat the command name as a pathname for an external program, the command name must contain a `/`.   As it turns out, every directory in UNIX contains two hidden directories `.` and `..`.  Where `.` is a shortcut for the name of the directory and `..` is a short cut for the name of the parent of the directory.  Using this feature, we can construct a name of a file within the current working directory that contains a slash by using `./` as a prefix.  Eg. to trigger the explicit request to execute `myfile` in the current directory as an external command, we can use `./myfile`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Details of how path names are decoded can be found in the \"path_resolution\" man page (`man path_resolution`).  \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Commands as files within the PATH list\n",
    "\n",
    "Using pathnames lets us ask the shell to try and execute a file as a process.  However, this is not sufficient to make execution of external programs feel like builtin commands.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Notice, there is another pathway in the flow chart for reaching STEP B - external command execution.  Specifically, if the command name is not a user defined function (see [Functions](#functions)),  or a shell builtin command, then the shell will look to see if the command is the name of a file within a set of directories.  The set of directories is the current value of the shell's PATH variable.  Specifically, the PATH variable is treated as a colon separated list of directories to be searched for files that will be launched as external commands.  The list is searched from left to right.   If the name of the command matches the name of a file within the directory being searched, then the file will be treated as an external command and the shell will attempt to execute it.  Note, the first match will terminate the search. In the event that directories later in the path also contain a file that matches the command name, they will not be considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice three critical points to this design:\n",
    "1. Files within the set of directories listed in PATH do not require use of path names to be executed.  This makes them feel more like builtin commands.  Simply adding files to one of the directories listed by the PATH variable is enough to make the program become a \"command\".\n",
    "2. The PATH variable is just an ordinary shell variable that can be updated anytime one likes.   It can be set to any value(s).  Thus, you can easily add directories of files to it, and/or remove directories from it. Further, remember that every terminal connection has an independent shell process connected to it, each with their own version of the PATH variable.  As such, you can override the PATH in one shell process while leaving it untouched in another. \n",
    "3. By controlling the order of directories in PATH, you can override which version of a file should be launched as the command.  In this way, you can provide alternative \"personalities\" to the commands by providing your own versions in directories that appear before the directories with the standard versions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's explore this in a little more detail by examining how the `cat` command gets located.  First, lets see if `cat` is a built in by asking for `help` about it."

    "Now that we have seen how files can be located and treated as external commands by the shell, let's look a little closer at how they are executed as new processes.  In order to do this, we need to take a step back and try and understand a little more about what processes and programs are, and their relationship to each other and the Operating System kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### The Birth of Processes\n",
    "\n",
    "In the introduction chapter we visualized a [set of processes](../unix/intro.ipynb#UnixViz_sec), where each was represented as a bubble above the UNIX kernel.  Each was labeled with the \"program\" it is running. Further, we said that each has its own \"lifetime\" -- it gets started and can run for some arbitrary amount of time, and once that time is up it terminates eg. exits.  This is the common model for a running \"App\" - running on our phones, laptops, or other devices - that we have all grown accustomed to.  \n",
    "\n",
    "On UNIX, a running App is a process.  Remember that on UNIX a shell process is automatically started for us when we open a terminal connection. This shell process, in turn, lets us start other processes. This is surprisingly similar to the way we start a running App across operating systems, and the relationship between the initial shell process and those it spawns can be likened to the relationship between an operating system and the applications it starts. That is to say, starting a process through a shell command line and launching an app by touching or double clicking an icon, while they might feel quite different, are one in the same behind the scenes. An initial App - that we as humans interact with - lets us start other Apps. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Parent and Child Processes:* On UNIX processes are organized as a tree.  Processes started by another process are called children of the starting process.  Similarly, the process that started a particular process is its parent.  Parent processes can exert a certain level of control over their child processes.  We will discuss this in more detail in the next chapter.  For the moment, this should be good enough for us to understand this critical step in command line processing. \n",
    "% What exactly is the mechanism that the Shell uses to run particular files as external commands, and what relationship does the shell have to these files? \n",
    "\n",
    "*Binary Executables:*  We have been somewhat vague about what makes a file a \"program\" from which a running App can be started.   Every operating system has a very particular file format, the way the information  of a file is encoded in bytes, that makes it possible for the operating system kernel to start new running Apps from it.    Such files go by several generic names, \"executables\" and \"binaries\" are common ones.   Much of the next Part of this book is about understanding exactly what a binary executable is and how to construct one.  For the moment it is sufficient for us to know that many of the files in the directories, within our path, are properly formatted  UNIX binaries.  This means that the UNIX kernel can start processes from them.  The binary executable format used by the LINUX kernel is called \"Executable and Linkable Format (ELF)\".  So binary executables on Linux are \"ELF files\". \n",
    "\n",
    "Using the \"file\" command we can confirm that both `bash` and `ls` are ELF files"

    "Let's recall where we are in the flow of Processing a Command Line.  We are at [Step 4: Execute the Command, Sub-step B: request kernel to execute as external command](#fig:executionsteps).   The figures to the left illustrate a breakdown of what happens in this sub-step.  At the start, we know the file that corresponds to the external command, the arguments to be passed to it, and any redirections that need to be established for the process that will be created.  In the example, the file is \"/usr/bin/ls\", a single argument,`/etc`, is being passed to it, and no redirections have been specified.  Given the lack of redirections, we expect the standard streams of the new process to be connected to the same places that the launched `bash` process's standard streams are connected to. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the example illustrated, we see that initially we have our `bash` process, which has its standard streams connected to an external terminal.  This is represented by the thick red arrow that connects the process through the communication hardware to the outside world. In the next chapter when we visualize files within the kernel we will be more detailed on how the kernel enables this connection.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The core functionality of this step is illustrated in the middle sub-figure.  The `bash` process, on our behalf, makes use of two kernel system calls; 1) fork, and 2) exec.  At this point, the details of these calls are not particularly important.  What matters is that the shell passes to the `exec` system call the path of the file to be executed, along with the list of arguments, and a copy of the 'exported' shell variables.  \n",
    "We will say more about the 'exported' shell variables when we discuss the [execution environment](#sec:env).\n",
    "\n",
    "When this sequence of calls completes, a new child process of the `bash` process will be started from the file specified, in this case `/usr/bin/ls`.  Now, as illustrated in the third and final bottom sub-figure, two processes exist; the original parent `bash` process, and its new child, the `ls` process.   This new child process will have a copy of the arguments and environment variables that were passed to the `exec` system call.  By default, its standard streams will be connected to the same locations that its parent  process's streams were connected to when it started the child.  In our example, this is illustrated by the two red, thick, dashed arrows going to the same external connection (eg. the same external terminal).\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, the new `ls` process is running independently of its parent `bash`.  "

The kernel will keep track of all of the processes that are eligible to run (\"RUNNABLE\") versus those that are waiting (\"BLOCKED\") on some event.  For the RUNNABLE ones, the kernel will keep rotating which processes are using the CPUs.  For those that are blocked, eg. waiting to get input from a terminal or waiting for another process to terminate, the kernel will monitor if the event they are blocked on occurs, at which point they can be unblocked and made RUNNABLE.\n",

    "\n",
    "The default behavior of the shell to start an external command as a child process, wait for it to exit and gather its exit status before going on to do anything else.  We call this step-by-step behavior, \"Synchronous\".  The shell process is synchronizing what it's going to do next with the exit of the process it launched to execute the current command.  In other words, we can't have the shell do anything else until the current command exits as it is \"stuck\" waiting for it to exit.  \n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The synchronous behavior is illustrated in our example to the right.  We see that, after launching the child process for `ls` the shell calls one of the `wait` system calls.  The kernel pauses, \"blocks\", the shell process at this point.  This means that the shell will not execute any more of its steps until the kernel decides to un-pause it. In the meantime the child `ls` process can execute steps of its program which will use kernel calls to examine the directory `/etc` and print a summary of its contents to its standard output stream.  Given that in our case, no redirections were specified, the output will go to the same terminal that its parent `bash` is connected to.  When the `ls` program is complete and exits, a call to the kernel's `exit` system call will be made.  The kernel will recognize that the `bash` process was blocked waiting its child process to exit and un-pause the `bash` process.  As part of this un-pausing the kernel will let the call `bash` made to the `wait` system call will return.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exit Status\n",
    "\n",
    "When a process calls the `exit` system call it passes an integer to the kernel.  This value is called the process's \"Exit Status\".  The `wait` system call, in addition to allowing a parent to wait for a child to exit also passes the parent the exit status that the child passed to the kernel when called `exit`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The shell provides a special variable that stores the exit status of the last command.  This variable has the somewhat odd name of the dollar symbol, `?`.  So right after the current command exits we can use the `?` variable to access the exit status of the command.  Given how the variable expansion works we can view the value by using the expansion syntax of `$?`.  For example"

Our goal was to have the shell get to step B of the [flow chart of command line processing](#fig:executesteps), and have the kernel successfully start it as a new process so that decision 5 would result in a No, and the shell would proceed to step 5 of command line processing.  To trigger this pathway we needed to make sure the kernel would - on its own - be able to identify the file as a script.  \n",

We will be discussing what exactly a `binary` program is later.  Regardless, if the file asked to be launched is marked as executable, but not a binary, the kernel will examine the beginning of the file.  If it finds the pattern `#!<path>` it will try starting the specified  <path> as a process, passing in the original file as the new process's first argument.  \n",

    "In our `cat` example, the kernel examines the file to start a new process.  The file is not a binary, rather, it is just a file of ascii lines.   As such, it will examine it and find the  first line and realize that it must launch the specified `binary` and pass the original file as the first argument.  In this case, the kernel starts `/bin/bash`, passing `/home/jovyan/mybin/cat` as its first argument.  So in our case, it turns out to be the equivalent to: `/bin/bash /home/jovyan/mybin/cat`.   Conveniently, when the new `bash` process starts and reads the first line it will ignore it, as it starts with a `#` and will be treated as a comment.  This is why so many interpreted languages use `#` as their comment character.\n",

    "Notice the shell command line execution steps do provide us a way to have `myscript` started as an external shell script command without adding the first line.    Examine the [flow chart of command line processing](#fig:executesteps), and look at step `D`.  If the kernel fails to be able to start a new process from the specified file, the behavior of step `D` is to start a new shell process passing the specified file as a script to it.   So the default behavior is that any non-binary file that is marked as executable will be treated as a **shell script**.

    "\n",
    "A very important operation we often want to do is search for lines that contain something we are looking for.  UNIX has a long history of tools and mechanisms for searching ASCII line-oriented data.  As a matter of fact, an entire language developed for describing a pattern to search for.  This language is called [Regular Expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) and a particular pattern in this language is referred to as a regular expression. \n",
    "You will often see the shorthand \"regex\" to refer to a regular expression.  Over the years various variants of the regular expression syntax have arisen.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Many different UNIX tools understand some variant of the regular expression syntax.  In general, it can take some time to learn the nuances of the regular expression syntax.  Most of us start by using regular expressions in the context of some UNIX commands, and in time grow our knowledge.  Our goal here is not to focus on the regular expression syntax, but rather just introduce the UNIX program called `grep`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "`grep` is a powerful tool that lets us search ASCII lines of text for a pattern written using a regular expression syntax.  The main argument to `grep` is a regex.   By default, `grep` will search each line it reads from the standard input stream and see if the line contains a match for the regex it was passed.  If a match is found, `grep` will print the line to it standard output.  In this way, `grep` can be used to filter out only lines that contain something you are looking for.   \n",
    "\n",
    "At this point we are only going to use very simple regexs, where the regex is simply a sequence of standard letters.  As such, if the line contains one or more occurrences of the sequence, including within a word, the line will be printed to standard output, and if not it will be skipped.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Lets see an example.  We start by starting grep with a regex of `Jill`, then we enter some lines of text, and press control-d to close the standard input stream.  \n"

This means that when we start a pipeline, as a \"normal\", synchronous command the shell will not get the next command line until all processes of the current job complete.  \n",

    "### Open File Descriptors\n",
    "\n",
    "The final aspect of the command execution environment that we want to focus on is the open file descriptors.  Recall the UNIX kernel maintains a table of open file descriptors for every process.  As such, each process has its own table that gets updated as the process executes file operations such as `open` and `close` system calls. Where the first establishes a new entry in the process's table the second clears an entry.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, remember that a process identifies an open stream as a index into its file descriptor table, with indexes 0, 1 and 2 having special meaning as standard input, standard output and standard error.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the kernel launches a new process, it initializes the new process's file descriptor table to be a copy of the parent's.  In this way, the parent can pass along open input and output streams to its children.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This is why external commands, which run as child processes of a shell, by default will have their standard streams connected to the same places as the shell processes that launched them.\n",
    "\n",
    " When we specify re-directions, the shell will open, close and copy file descriptors to set things up correctly for the new program to be executed. After doing this, the shell starts the child binary running.  From the new program's perspective, it does not need to do anything to set up the standard stream connections.\n",

    "```{admonition} Fork and Exec\n",
    "\n",
    "On UNIX, the way a new child process is created to run a different binary is actually a two step procedure. First, the parent calls `fork` to create a child process that is running a copy of the same program as the parent.  As such, the `fork` call returns twice - once in the parent and once in the child.  To distinguish the two, it returns a different value to the parent and child.  As a separate system call, a process can replace the binary that it is running with the `exec` system call.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To start an external command as a process,  a shell in UNIX will typically first `fork` a copy of itself. The child shell process will automatically inherit the working directory, environment variables, and open file descriptors.   The child will then use the `open`, `close`, and `dup` system calls to set up any necessary redirections.  After this, the child shell process will call `exec` to start the specified binary for the external command.  At this point, the child is no longer running the shell binary (eg. `/bin/bash`) but rather is running the specified binary of the external command (eg. `/bin/ls`)\n",
    "\n",
    "The parent shell will then go on to either wait for the child to exit, or immediately proceed to the next command depending on if the command was started with the background operator.\n",

    "In a modern UNIX system, the kernel is maintaining a lot of information for every process.  The working directory, file descriptor table, and exported environment variables are the core standard ones that the shell provides to a new process it starts. \n",
    "There are two additional standard ones that a UNIX kernel maintains for every process.   1) the default \"file creation mode mask\" and 2) the set of \"ignored` signals\".  We will touch upon both of these things, along with \"credentials\", in the next chapter when we delve further into processes.\n",
