It has 151 simple operations - versus the thousands of complex operations supported by a modern [Intel X86-64 processor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64), which is widely used in computers ranging from laptops to supercomputers.  The following article discusses how to calculate the number of operations an Intel x86-64 processor supports and why it is hard to do so;  [\"Enumerating x86-64 – It’s Not as Easy as Counting\"]([https://www.unomaha.edu/college-of-information-science-and-technology/research-labs/_files/enumerating-x86-64-instructions.pdf).   Given the simplicity of the 6502 we will often use it to first get our heads around an idea or mechanism, before looking at the same thing on an Intel X86-64 based computer or an [ARM Arch64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AArch64) based computer.         \n",

    "The mnemonic for all of them is `ADC`.  The thing that distinguishes the different forms of related operations, such as adding two numbers, is where the values to add will come from and where the results will go. These parameters are often called the **operands** of an instruction.  In assembly code we write the program as a sequence of instructions along with syntax that specifies the operands.  A tool called the assembler is then used to translate our assembly program into the corresponding machine code.   The following is the same 6502 program to add $1+1$ written in assembly code:\n",

    "```assembly\n",

    ">ca65 add.s \n",
    ">```\n",
    ">This produces a new file named `add.o` that has the machine code version encoded within it. This is called an object file. The object file contains the binary coded values but does not specify where and how exactly they should go in the memory of the computer nor does it describe how to setup the CPU.  In some sense the object file is just a fragment of an executable program.  We use another tool called a linker to convert and combine object files into a complete exectuable memory \"image\" that describes the exact location and values that need to be placed in memory and how to configure the CPU to get the program to run.  For example `ld65 add.o -C SOL6502.cfg -o add.img` invokes the linker on our `add.o` with a description of the SOL6502 computer's memory layout.  This produces a file `add.img` that is an exact copy of what needs to be loaded into the entire memory of the SOL6502 computer.\n",

    "Unlike our previous machine code version, the assembly language version is written using mnemonics. It also has comments, thus making it at least \"readable\" by a human.  However, unlike other programming languages that you might be familiar with, you likely still cannot REALLY read it (except maybe for the comments).  Eg. you probably cannot tell that it a simple program to add two numbers or how and why it works.    For that matter, even if you can figure out what it does, how do you get at the result?\n",

    "As we will see later, the assembly language, understood by the assembler, includes additional syntax for carefully controlling and placing arbitrary values in memory beyond just opcodes.  Assembly programming is all about understanding how the computer works and creating an initial image of memory that, when loaded, will get the computer to do what you want.  "

Rather than needing to understand and remember of all the details of machine code, a programmer can simply learn the assembly language and then rely on the assembler to translate it correctly into machine code.  The assembler is a program whose job is to do this translation -- in some sense it acts like a machine code programmer that we give an assembly code version of our program.   In a similar manner, we can design a new programming language and write a translation program written in assembly language that translates the new language into assembly language, and then use the assembler to translate the result into machine code.   A programmer that learns our new language need never know about assembly or machine language! \n"
