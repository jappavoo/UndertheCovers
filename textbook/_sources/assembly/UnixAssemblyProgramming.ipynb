    "Perhaps the most basic thing we do on a computer is run programs.  As we have seen, on UNIX, one of the main purposes of the shell is to let us start and manage running programs -- Processes.  As a recap remember that when we type a command like `ls` into a shell, that is not a built-in command (eg. `ls`), the shell will look to see if a file, with a matching name, exists in the list of directories specified by the `PATH` envionment variable.  If one is found (eg `/bin/ls`), and it's meta data marks it as \"executable\", the shell process will make calls to the UNIX kernel to create a new child process and try and \"run\" the file within then new process.

    "As the figures state there are two basic kinds of files that the kernel knows how to \"execute\" within a process.  One is an ASCII file that has a special string at its beginning -- `#!<path of interpreter>` and the other is an **executable**.  The former is just a convient way to allow programs like the shell to automatically be started with the contents of the file passed to it as a script to interpret.  This makes it easy to write \"scripts\" that behave as if they where programs of their own.  When in reality they are being interpreted as commands to the \"real\" program specified on the first line of the file.  But the quesiton of course what exactly are real programs or **executables**."

    "`xxd` conviently lets us look at the value of a file represent in base 2 binary digits or base 16 hexadecimal digits.   We will use the following command to display the first 256 bytes of the file in binary: `xxd -l 256 -g 1 -c 8 -b /bin/ls`\n",
    "\n",
    "Where: \n",
    " - `-l 256` is used to restrict ourselves to the first 80 bytes\n",
    " - `-g 1` is used to tell xxd to work on units/groups of single bytes\n",
    " - `-c 8` is used to print 8 units/groups per line\n",
    " - `-b` means display the values in base 2 (binary) notation\n",
    "\n",
    "This causes `xxd` to open `/bin/ls` and read the first 256 bytes.  It examines the value of each byte read and translates it so that it produces a string of eight ASCII characters of either `0` or `1` depending on the value of the bits of the byte.  In this way we can use `xxd` to diplay the byte values of a file.  The left hand column of the output encodes the byte position in the file that the line of data correponds too.  These position values start at zero are in hexadecimal notation (eg. `00000010` is 16 in decimal).  On the far right of each line `xxd` prints an ASCII interpretation for any byte values that correspond to printable ASCII characters (otherwise it prints a `.`)."

Further reading between the lines the \"file\" to be executed contains or is the base of the new process image.
