    "Perhaps the most basic thing we do on a computer is run programs.  As we have seen, on UNIX, one of the main purposes of the shell is to let us start and manage running programs -- Processes.  As a recap remember that when we type a command like `ls` into a shell, it is not a built-in command. The shell will look to see if a file, with a matching name, exists in the list of directories specified by the `PATH` environment variable.  If one is found (eg `/bin/ls`), and it's meta data marks it as \"executable\", the shell process will make calls to the UNIX kernel to create a new child process and try and \"run\" the file within the new process.

The memory of each context is colored with the color of the executable they were started with.  In this case `Context 0` was initialized with `/bin/ls`, `Context 1` and `Context 2` from `/bin/bash` and finally `Context 3` with an executable file called `mypgm`.

Any common libraries of routines an executable uses are not in the executable.  Rather the executable simply includes a list of the libraries and routines it requires.  When creating a process for such a \"dynamically linked\" executable a dynamic loader-linker  will validate that the required files can be found.   It then ensures that as the process is run the values from the other file are added to the process context.  This approach has several nice properties.  The sizes of binaries are considerably smaller and it now possible to upgrade libraries and have new process, started from exiting binaries, automatically use them.  \n",

    "The second technique, Memory Paging, refers to the OS using the [Memory Management Unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_management_unit) facilities of the CPU to avoid having the entire  memory of a process context present in the computers physical memory.  Specifically, the OS uses hardware \"paging\" features to carve up a process context memory into chunks called pages.  At any given time the only pages that need to be present are the ones that the executing process is currently conducting memory transactions too.   The other pages, of currently schedule process and, non-schedule processes can be stored on I/O devices.  The OS then shuffles the pages in and out of main memory as needed.  Treating the main memory as a form a \"cache\" for the active pages of the running processes. This allows us to run many programs who's \"virtual\" memory is larger than the physical memory of the computer.\n",

If we want to put values in other sections, such as data we would then switch sections.  The next line `.global _start` tells the assembler to place the symbolic label that is introduced on the following in the list of \"external\" symbols that this object file is making visible to the other object files.  The reason we do this is due to a requirement that every executable needs to define a symbol that tells the OS how to initialize the PC when it creates a new process context from the executable.  This symbol is call the entry point.   On Linux the default symbol the linker looks for as the entry point is `_start`.  So in combination the two lines say that file is defining an externally visible symbol `_start` and defines it to be the location of the values that follow.  Since we have not inserted any values yet we are still at the beginning of the text memory that this object file defines.  \n",

The `.byte` directive expects us to list one more comma separated values that the assembler will translate into binary values and place in the object file.  The assembler understands many formats for the values.\n",
    "In our case we are using hex notation and simply specify eight bytes all zero valued.  Each byte moves the insertion point to the next offset relative to the current section.  As such these two lines tell the assembler that we want this object file to contribute 8 zero value bytes to the text values of the final linked executable.  "
