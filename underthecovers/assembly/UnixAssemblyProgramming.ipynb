As a recap remember that when we type a command like `ls` into a shell, that is not a built-in command (eg. `ls`), the shell will look to see if a file, with a matching name, exists in the list of directories specified by the `PATH` envionment variable.  If one is found (eg `/bin/ls`), and it's meta data marks it as \"executable\", the shell process will make calls to the UNIX kernel to create a new child process and try and \"run\" the file within then new process.
