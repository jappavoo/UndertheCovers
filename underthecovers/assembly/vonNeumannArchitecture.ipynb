These challenges and the current approachs to trying to mitigate them also has an effect on how one needs to write software that will perform well on modern hardware.  We don't really need to worry about that right now but it is a theme we will revist later once we have a core understanding of the basics of how software and hardware interact."

    "In the <a href=\"#fig:physcpus\">Examples of physical CPUs figure</a>, above, we see photos of some physical cpus along with a \"pin out\" diagram that describes how to physically connect it to the rest of the computer.  Over the years it is clear that the complexity of CPUs has certainly grown.  In the 1970's CPUs were composed of thousands of transistors and only required tens of pins to connect to rest of the computer.  By 2021 we see that cpus now contain billions of transistors and require thousands for physical connections to the reset of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "While an over-simplification, one of the uses of transistors in a CPU is to create, \"switches\" that from the logic circuts used to implement basic operations such as adding numbers. In order to make the CPU do these operations faster we need to be able to operate the transitors, turn them on and off, faster and faster.  Unfortunately doing so requires more and more energy and creates more more heat.  As such over the last decade it has become harder and harder to speed up CPUs, given the increase in energy and attendant increase in heat it leads too.   On the other hand we have managed to figure out how to continually shrink the size of transistors that has allowed us to pack more and more transistors into CPUs, however some believe that we are getting to end of this ability as we are approching the physical limits to how small we can make a transistor. \n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless we have reached a point that making cpus operate faster is very hard to do and while we might be able to fit more transitors on the chip we are at the limits of how many we have powered on at the same time (due to energy and heat constraints).  Finally it is also very hard to imagine that we can fit many more \"pins\" that connect the cpu to the rest of the computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the years these effects have resulted in a situation that the performance of the software we write has become more and more dependent on how it interacts with the internal way the extra transistors are used.  For example in a modern processor a large number of transistors are used to form what is called [cache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_cache) memory.  While software can benefit, its performance increases, from caches it is possible to write the same software in different ways that get greater or lesser benefit if you understand how the caches work and the way your software interacts with them.  Similarly today CPU's often use the extra transistors to create multiple internal sub-CPUs, called [cores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-core_processor).  A program, however does not automatically benefit from multiple cores unless it is written to explicity exploit them via \"parallel threads\" of execution.  But to understand how to do this one first needs to understand the classic model by which a single core CPU works and its interaction with memory.   \n",
    "\n",
    "The bottom line is CPU's are complex organizations of transistors and as we reach the physical limits to how we traditionaly build them the way software is written and structured becomes more and more important with respect to our ability to get computers to do more.  But the first step to understanding how to do this is understanding the basics of the von Neumann model of software execution that CPUs implement.  "

As a matter of fact if we consider the line of CPU's from INTEL software written on a 1970 verions of their products can still be run on the CPU's they produced in 2021 because at the heart of it the 2021 version still remains consistent with basic model of a computer built around the 1970's CPU. \n",

As we saw in Part I: The UNIX Development Environment software is largley broken down into two parts: 1) application software that runs within processes and 2) a single operating system kernel composed of software that provides all processes with a wide range of special functions.  This includes the abiliy to create processes from an executable file and to share the computer among the processes.  Most CPU's provide a special mode of execution for the OS kernel.  In this mode an expanded set of operations and SPRS are available for use.  OS kernel software uses the GPRS, SPRS and the expanded set of operations to implement is routines.  We typically call this mode of operation \"Priveliged\" and as such we often call the kernel software priveledged code.  expanded access to the hardware resources of the computer and the application or user software as unprivedged.   Many CPUs expand on this idea to provide multiple levels of priviledge which enables a further degree of layering of the systems softwae.  For example may CPUs use extra levels of priviledge to introduction support for a virtual machine monitor (or hypervisor) layer of software that can sit below standard operating system kernels and allow the hardware to be shared by multiple OS's each thinking they are running on the computer by themselves.\n",
