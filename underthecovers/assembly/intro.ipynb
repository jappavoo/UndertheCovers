    "Assembly Programming, directing the computer in what it should do, means writing code in the language that the hardware of the computer understands -- or at least very close to it. \n",
    "Most programmers are completely unaware of how the computer really works as the languages that they program in are not natively supported by the hardware.  Rather, most languages, such as JavaScript, Java, Python, Ruby, Rust, C#, C++, and even C must be translated into the native code that the computer does understand -- machine code.  \n",

    "The hardware of the computer is built out of electrical components that can store and interpret patterns of  bits, binary digits.  A single bit can be though of as a switch that can be in two positions \"ON\" -- 1  and \"OFF\" -- 0.  A group of eight bits forms a byte.  We will say  a lot more about bytes  a little <a href=\"\">later</a>.  The main thing to observe is that a byte is easily expressed as an 8 digit binary, (base 2), number.  Given that there are 8 bits a byte can take on $2^8=256$ \n",

It has 151 simple operations versus the thousands of complex operations supported by an modern [Intel X86-64 processor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64) which is widely used in computers ranging from laptops to supercomputers.  The following article discusses how to calculate the number of operations an Intel x86-64 processor supports and why it is hard to do so;  [\"Enumerating x86-64 – It’s Not as Easy as Counting\"]([https://www.unomaha.edu/college-of-information-science-and-technology/research-labs/_files/enumerating-x86-64-instructions.pdf).   Given the simplicity of the 6502 we will often use it to first get our heads around an idea or mechanism, before looking at the same thing on an Intel X86-64 based computer or an [ARM Arch64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AArch64) based computer.         \n",

    "Assembly code is a slightly more generic human friendly code that we can use to program a computer.  Machine code must be expressed purely in numbers but assembly code uses structured text that can be easily translated by a set of tools into the equivalent machine code.   Each group of machine operations of the CPU that does the same function is assigned a human text **memonic**, often referred to as an **instruction**.  For example the following are the 8 different 6502 machine code operations that add two numbers:\n",
    "\n",

    "| ADC | $01111101$ | add with carry - abs,X: Absolute Indexed with X a,x |\n",
    "\n",
    "The memonic for all of them is `ADC`.  The thing that distinguishes the different forms of related operations, such as adding two numbers, is where the values to add will come from and where the results will go. These parameters are often called the **operands** of an instructions.  In assembly code we write the program as a sequence of instructions along with syntax that specifies the operands.  A tool called the assembler is then used to translated our assembly program into the corresponding machine code.   The following is the same 6502 program to add $1+1$ written in assembly code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```assembly\n",
    "    CLC         ; Clear the Carry Flag\n",
    "    LDA #1      ; Load the accumulator with the value 1\n",
    "    ADC #1      ; Add the value 1 to the accumulator \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    ">Using an editor we could write the above into a file (eg. add.s) and then use a 6502 assembler to translate it into 6502 machine code. eg.\n",
    ">```shell\n",
    ">ca65 add.s \n",
    ">```\n",
    ">This produces a new file, named `add.o` that has the machine code version encoded within it, this is called and object file. The object file contains the binay coded values but does not specify where and how exactly they should go in the mmory of the computer nor does it describe how to setup the CPU.  In some sense the object file is just a fragment of an executable program.  We use another tool called a linker to convert and combine object files into a complete exectuable memory \"image\" that describes the exact location and values that need to be place in memory and how to configure the CPU to get the program to run.  For example `ld65 add.o -C SOL6502.cfg -o add.img` invokes the linker on our `add.o` with a description of the SOL6502 computer's memory layout.  This produces a file `add.img` that is an exact copy of what needs to be loaded into the entire memory of the SOL6502 computer.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Unlike our previous machine code version the assembly language version is written using the memonics and also has comments thus making it at least \"readable\" by a human.  However, unlike other programming languages that you might be familiar with you likely still cannot REALLY read it.  Eg. you probably cannot tell that it a simple program to add two numbers or how and why it works.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To understand assembly language we need to understand what the operations of the CPU are and what they do.  And to achieve this we must understand the basic functioning of the CPU and the rest of the hardware that makes up the computer. \n",
    "    \n",
    "### Assembly Programming \n",
    "As we will see later the assembly language, understood by the assembler, includes additional syntax for carefully controlling and placing arbitrary value in memory beyond just opcodes.  Assembly programming is all about understanding how the computer works and creating a initial image of memory that when loaded will get the computer to do what you want.  "

Rather than needing to understand and remember of all the details of machine code a programmer can simply learn the assembly language and then rely on the assembler to translate it correctly into machine code.  The assembler is a program who's job is to do this translation -- in some sense it acts like a machine code programmer that we give an assembly code version of our program.   In a similar manner we can design a new programming language and write a translation program written in assembly lnaguage that translate the new language into assembly language and then use the assembler to translate the result into machine code.   A programmer that learns our new language need never now about assembly or machine language! \n"
