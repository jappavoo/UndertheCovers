In some sense we are using multiple terminals to form our own Integrated Development Environmnt (IDE) where we are using each terminal as if it were a subwindow of our IDE.  In actuality the editor that we will be using (emacs) has support for integrating all three tasks within itself but for the moment we will keep things seperate to make sure we know what is going on and not tie ourselves to this particular editor (there are many others including the popular VIM)."

    "To execute our code we must convert the \"source\" into a binary executable that can be loaded into memory and contains all the data and instructions (at the right locations).  To do this we must use programs that converts our assembly code into the \"correct\" raw binary values and assigns the those values to address.   The OS will load these values to the specified locations when we ask it to run our program.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This process of converting human readable source code into a binary executable format is often referred to as \"building\".  The tools we will use are an assembler and a linker.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The assembler's has been written to convert the human names (\"memonics\") of the instructions in our source files into the binary code that our CPU understands.  There is no magic!   The manufacuter of the CPU publishes a manual that defines what instructions the CPU supports.  Each instruction has a human \"memonic\" (eg.  `mov rax, <value>`) and the binary code that the CPU understands (eg. `mov rax, 0xdeadbeef` is `0x48,0xb8,0xef,0xbe,0xad,0xde,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00`).  Given the manual a programmer writes the assemble to go over our source files and translates what we write into the cpu binary code.  The programmer extends the memonics with what are called \"directives\" such as `.intel_syntax, .text, .global, .quad, etc` that we can use to control and direct the assemble.   To fully understand all the syntax and what we can do one must look at both the manual for the CPU and for the assembler.  If all goes well and our program does not have any syntax errors then the assembler will generate a file with its output. This file is called an object file.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We use a tool called a linker to process the object files that makes up our program to create a binary executable specific to our operating system and cpu.  It is this file that is \"really\" our program.  The linkers job is to prodess all our object files to create the binary with knowledge of where our OS wants things to be placed in memory (in our simple examples there is only one, later on we will have other object files from libraries of functions that we will want to use as well).  Specifically the developers of the OS provide information to the linker that tells it the rules of where instructions and data can go.  It is the linkers job to figure out what addresses each of the values that makes up our program should be given.  As such it also needs to fix up our code so that the final addresses are reflect for each of the places in our code where we reference particular symbolic names.  We will talk more about this later.  Assuming all goes well and the linker does not flag any errors then it will produce a binary executable that the OS can load and run.  One special task of the linker is to mark in the binary the address of the first instruction so that the OS can be sure to initialize the CPU correctly to start executing instructions from the right starting location -- this location is called the \"entry point\".   Our linker by default assumes that our code contains a symbol named `_start`.  If so the address it assigns to `_start` is what it will write into the executable as the entry point so that the OS can load and start our program correct.  If we fail to define the `_start` label the linker will produce an warning and man an assumption.  It is a bad idea to ignore warnings when programming at this level ... after all we know what assuming makes of you and me.\n",
    "\n",
    "So in the shell above we will run a command (`gcc --static -g -nostartfiles -nolibc popcnt.S -o popcnt`) that runs both the assembler and linker for us.  We will have to pay close attention to see if there are any errors.  If so we need to go up to the editor make changes and save those changes.  Then try building again.  We repeat this untill there are no build time errors.  Remember the executable is different from the source any change we make to the program source code requires that we rerun the build process to update the binary.   Remember just because there are no build time errors does not mean that our code is \"right\" or free of bugs.  \n",
