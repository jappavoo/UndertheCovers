	# one by one but before you step and instruction
	# 1) display the destination register
	# 2) examine the value in memory you think it will be loaded with
	# 3) write down on a paper your guess
	# 4) step the instruction
	# 5) display the destination register and see if you were right
	#    if not try and figure out why not

	# Quick discussion about sections and organizing our memory into
        # data and text portions
	
	# Sections let us seperate out our programs memory into
	# distinct non-overlaping areas.  The two sections
	# we will use are .text and .data
	#
	# .text is for opcodes     (bytes to be executed)
	# .data is for data values (bytes to be read and written by our program
	#
	# We switch sections with the .section directive
	# All bytes for a section will be grouped together by the linker and
	# placed in a single contingous area of memory when a process is created
	#
	# Every assembly file can add bytes to either section
	# You can switch sections at any point in your assembly files
	
	# Switch current section to the data section
	.section .data
	
	# set a label MYBYTES to the begin of the following bytes
MYBYTES:    
	.quad 0xdeadbeeffeedface   # reserve 8 bytes initialized to
	                           # the value indicated in hex

	# Switch current section to the text section
	.section .text
