The kernel functions that a process can request are called system calls.  In the next part of this book we will look at the  details for how a process can make a request to the kernel to execute a system call.  For the moment it is sufficient to know that each system call, which we identify by names, can only be requested by an already running program.  When a process makes a request to execute a system call it can pass arguments to the system call and the kernel on completion can return values back to the process.  Operating system kernels can provide hundreds of system calls.  The white labeled boxes within the kernel oval, in the diagram to the left, illustrates a small number of important UNIX kernel system calls. \n",

It does this by: 1) accepting human oriented commands from a user, 2) executing kernel system calls to get the work of the commands done, and 3) sending a response back.  The shell includes the ability to locate other executable programs and launch new processes from them.    \n",

Specifically its syntax and commands are designed to itself form an \"extensible\" programming language.  Extensible hear means the ability for it to easily added to by the users.

The common short hand notation for the newline byte value is `\\n`.  Pressing the *return*  or *enter* key, depending on your keyboard, within a terminal window will generate this value.

So far in our case, this program is the shell, later we will see that programs that we run from the shell can be allowed to take over this role.   In character mode the terminal data is sent along to the program running as soon as they are received, including the `\\n`.  In line (or buffered mode) the kernel stores up the characters sent until it receives a `\\n`.   At which point it sends the complete line with the `\\n` to the program running. The default mode is typically line mode.  For the most part it does not really matter to us as the shell's behavior is largely the same as it is a line oriented program that is designed to process whole lines at a time.

If we were to use special device, such as a [logic analyzer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_analyzer), to peek at the electical wires that make up the path ways that are transmitting data back and forth between the computer and the terminal we would find electical values that encode the binary for the characters being exchanged. \n",

You might be wondering why is it that you see the characters you type at the keyboard of terminal appear on the screen of the terminal.  If pressing a key really sends the data to the Unix kernel and then to the program running, such as the shell, there is not reason we would see it.  Does the Shell send a copy back of what it receives?  No it does not.  Rather typically the UNIX kernel is configured, by default, to send back a copy of what it receives on a specific terminal connection back to the terminal itself.  This setting is called terminal ECHO mode.  So by default even before the Kernel sends data up to the destination program it sends a copy back to the terminal so that the user can see what they typed.  This includes the `\\n` that the user pressed to indicate the end of the command line.  Hence, in this default mode any data sent back from the shells behavior will appear on a new-line.  Programs can ask the kernel to disable this setting to have more control of what the users sees.  As a matter of fact like many things in Unix there is a command you can issue to have the kernel adjust the setting for you terminal connect including turning off the echo behavior (`stty -echo` to turn off and `stty echo` to turn back on).  Doing so lets you observe what is really being sent back in response to your command and not what the kernel automatically generated as echo data.  Note things might get confusing quickly if you turn echo off.   But Unix is all about understanding how things work and have the power to control them.  If you want to know more try `man stty` but be warned you will find that communications on a terminal is actually quite a bit more complex than it might seem -- there is a lot of history and skeletons buried here and the kernel is *cooking* the communications quite a bit ;-)"

    "When the shell receives a command line it goes through a series of steps to process it.  The rules of this processing define what is called the [Shell Grammar](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/bash.1.html#SHELL_GRAMMAR).  The Shell Grammar and builtin commands form an entire programming language.  Programs written in this language are called Shell Scripts and are used extensively to automate all sorts of tasks.     Over the years one learns more and more subtle aspects and usage of the shell grammar.  While it is possible to use the shell without really knowing its underlying grammar having a working knowledge can really help in understanding why the shell behaves the way it does and its somewhat strange syntax.\n",

    "### Interactive vs non-interactive (scripts) \n",
    "\n",
    "The two ways we use the shell are either interactively or non-interactive. In either case the core operation of the shell is the same -- process command lines.  The difference is in the interactive mode the commands are coming from a human though a terminal connection versus a file in the non-interactive mode.  In the interactive case after each command line is executed the shell sends the prompt to the human and waits for them to send the next command line.   In non-interactive mode the command lines are being read from a shell script file.  A shell script is a file simply containing several shell command lines. In this mode the command lines in the file are immediately executed one after the other and no prompting or waiting occurs.  \n",

    "5. optionally wait for command to complete\n",

    "### Step 1: Breaking down a \"Command line\" into Simple Commands and Arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "In this step the shell splits the command line up into a set of tokens that form a \"simple commands\".   Several simple commands can make up a single command line. The common boundary that separates tokens are \"blanks\".  Blanks are `space` and `tab` characters ([blanks](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/bash.1.html#DEFINITIONS)).   In the ASCII code, space characters are encoded with a byte value of `0x20` and a tab is encoded by `0x09`.  So a sequence of one more of these two characters will cause the shell to split what is before and after the sequence into to separate tokens.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<a id=\"meta_def\"></a>\n",
    "In addition to the blank `space` and `tab` characters the following characters `|  & ; ( ) < > newline` will also indicate the separation of tokens.  Together, these characters are known as the shell \"metacharacters\".  In time we will learn about how these characters affect the commands to be executed. Some will let us combine simple commands in various ways while others will effect how the command is executed.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Command versus Arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "The first token of simple command is the name of the command to execute.  The following tokens in a set will be passed to the command as arguments.     To know where the arguments of a particular simple command ends the shell looks for one of the following \"control\" operators.  Notice that some of the metacharacters, `| & ; ( )` and `newline` itself both separate tokens and terminate the tokens of simple command.    Using the control characters allow us to chain independent simple commands together. "

To begin with we have a tab  and space preceeding the first token.  Then we have our first token `echo`  which is our command.  The next space separates `echo` from the `hello`.  Two spaces then separate `hello` from `goodbye`.  Then tghe sequence of space, tab, space separate `goodbye` from `me`.  A single space seperates `me` from `again`.  `again` is terminated as a token by the following space, tab and newline.  So it is important to note that when the shell runs echo the seperating blanks will be eliminated and only the tokens will be passed to echo as individual arguments.  "

Shell variables are actually a special case of a what are called shell parameters. We will focus on variables. The shell provides certain special built in variables such as \"RANDOM\" whose value expands to a random number. As we will see later a very important built is the \"PATH\" variable.  There are several ways we can introduce our own variables and assign them a value.  The simplest is a command line of the form:  `name=value`.   During Parameter Expansion the `$` followed by name will trigger parameter expansion, optionally the name can be enclosed in braces `{name}`.  The token will then be expanded to the value if the named variable exists other wise the token will be simply removed.  The shell provides all kinds of fancy ways of manipulating and transforming the value of a variable during expansions, such as deleting or substituting portions, but we will leave that for later.  Finally shell variables can have attributes associated with them.   One important attribute marks a variable as exported.  We will see later that exported variables are passed to new programs as part of their initial \"environment\".  \n",

The shell will then look to see if there are files or directories that match the token subtituting the patterns as necessary.

    "### Step 3: Parse Redirections\n",
    "\n",
    "To fully understand what it means to parse redirections we must have a more complete understanding of how commands are run and the UNIX I/O model -- how a program can conduct input and output.    This understanding will take us a little time as it involves concepts such as Processes, Streams and Files and how they inter-relate.  At this point we take a simple view that we will build upon in time.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Processes\n",
    "\n",
    "As we go our understanding of what a process is will become more and more advanced.  For the moment our simple working definition will be a running program other than the kernel.   The shell we interact with is a process and the commands that we run from the shell run within it or as new processes.   We will look at this distinction in more detail when we discuss internal built-in versus external commands.   Regardless the commands we issue run as a process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Parse Redirections step is is all about controlling where the input and out for a process, comes from or goes to.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Streams: Standard Input, Output and Error\n",
    "\n",
    "UNIX provides three default \"streams\" that a process can use for its input and output.  The default streams are called: Standard Input, Standard Output and Standard Error.  A process can ignore these if it wants but most commands by default use these streams.  A stream is a connection to a source or destination for reading or writing bytes.  A process read bytes from a stream via `read` calls to the kernel. Such a stream is an input stream.  Similarly a stream that a process can write bytes to, via `write`  kernel calls, is an output stream.   As implied by the name a stream is like a \"flow\" of bytes.  Reading bytes from an input stream successively gets bytes from the source it is connected to.    Writing bytes to a stream successively sends more and more bytes to the connected destination.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ASCII streams\n",
    "\n",
    "What the bytes \"mean\" or what will be done with them is up to the process. Most of the daily UNIX commands we use assume ASCII line oriented data.  This means that most commands expect that the bytes they read from their standard input will be bytes that encode ASCII lines of data.  Similarly we can expect most commands to write ASCII lines of data to their standard output and error streams.  \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Standard Error\n",
    "\n",
    "The UNIX designers knew that it is very common to have commands produce \"normal\" output and \"error\" output.  To support this separation they decided to make it standard that processes get both, a standard output and error stream.  \n",
    "\n",
    "By convention when UNIX commands are being developed by a programmer they write them to send their \"normal\" output to the standard out stream.    When the programmer of a command wants to send error messages or warning messages they use the standard error stream.  This allows some one using a command to easily direct normal output to one destination and error output to another.   Eg. they might decide they want to ignore and hide all warning messages by redirecting the error stream to a different destination.   While for the most part we don't normally use this extra flexibility there are times when it comes in is very handy.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Streams and Files\n",
    "\n",
    "But where exactly do the bytes for a stream come from or go to?\n",
    "A common phrase that you may hear is that in UNIX everything is a file.  From this perspective streams are connections to files that allow a command to read or write the data of the file.   \n",
    "\n",
    "The designers of UNIX decided that they would try and represent all locations that might serve as a source or destination of data as files.  This includes even devices such as terminals.  To this end the UNIX kernel represents the majority of the devices of a computer as files that a stream can be connected too.   Reading from an input stream connected to a device \"file\" gets data from that device.  Writing to an output stream connected to a device file sends data to the device.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Opening streams and File Descriptors\n",
    "\n",
    "To connect a stream a program makes an \"open\" kernel call.  As part of the open call the program passes the path name of the file to connect the stream to and also specifies if the connection is for input or output (or both).  If successful the kernel will establish the connection.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For every process, running program, the kernel maintains a table of open streams. This table is called a file descriptor table.  Each entry in the table is either empty or not empty.  If empty the entry does not hold a description of an open stream.  If it is not empty then it does contain the information that describes an open stream.  The kernel can then use this descriptor information to operate on the stream, eg. read or write bytes to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "When an open call is made the kernel scans the table for next empty location and then stores the descriptor information about the newly open stream into that location.  The index of this newly populated table entry is returned back to the process.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Historically these indexes are themselves called **File Descriptor** numbers.  All the kernel operations on a stream, such as read and write, require a file descriptor so that the kernel knows what stream to operate on.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The first three  file descriptors; 0, 1, and 2 are the where connections for standard input, output and error are expected to be. \n",
    "\n",
    "> <img style=\"display: inline; margin: 1em 1em 0px 0px;\" align=\"left\" width=\"40\" src=\"../images/fyi.svg\"> <p style=\"background-color:powderblue;\">  The UNIX kernel also provides other operations that lets a process control its file descriptors.  This include the ability to close and mark one as empty via the `close` kernel call.  It also lets a process control its table of file descriptors via kernel calls such as `dup` and `dup2` that duplicated an table entry.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Terminals and Streams\n",
    "\n",
    "As we read an ASCII terminal provides a natural way for humans to both receive and send ASCII line oriented data.  When we connect to a UNIX system via a new terminal the kernel starts a shell for us and connects its standard streams to the particular device file that represents our terminal.   When the shell writes bytes such as the prompt to its standard output we see it in the terminal it is \"connected\" too.  Similarly when we type characters into the terminal the shell will receive them when it reads from its standard input.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Defaults\n",
    "\n",
    "When the shell runs a command it establishes what the commands standard input, output and error streams will be connected to.  The default is to connect them to the same streams that the shell is connected to.  In most cases this will be the terminal that the shell is interacting with.    This is the reason the input and output of a command, by default come from and go to the terminal, we are working within.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overriding the defaults\n",
    "\n",
    "Once steps 1 and 2 of command line processing have completed the shell has identified one or more commands along with arguments that we want executed.   In addition to commands and their arguments the shell gives us the ability to control where the input and output streams for a program might come from and go to.\n",
    "    \n",
    "As stated above if we don't use any of the special redirection support then the defaults will be used.   If however we use the redirection syntax then we can have the shell control what file descriptors a command will have open and where they will be connected to before they run.  While there are many advanced uses of the redirection syntax basic usage is straight forward.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "When discussing command line splitting we introduced that `<` and `>` are <a href=\"#meta_def\">metacharacters</a>.  Their primary use is to specify redirections.  The greater than character,  `>`,  is used to control output stream redirection. Conversely, the less than, `<` character is used to control input stream redirection.\n",
    "  \n",
    "The following examples introduce the basics. See the references for details of the syntax and more advanced uses.\n",
    "\n",
    "References:\n",
    "  - https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/bash.1.html#REDIRECTION\n",
    "  - https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#Redirections\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "#### Redirection Examples\n",
    "    \n",
    "In theses examples we will use  the `date`, `ls`, `cat`,  and `file` commands.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "- The `file` command, tells the \"type\" of the file that we specify as an argument.  We will use it to tell when we a file is a device file versus a regular file. \n",
    "- The `cat` command, by default, if no arguments are specified, reads bytes from the standard input stream and writes them to the standard output stream.  \n",
    "- The `ls` command, as we have seen, lists the contents of the specified directory to standard output.  By default, if no arguments are given then `ls` will list the contents of the current working directory.  \n",
    "- Finally the `date` command, if no arguments are given prints the current date and time to the standard output stream."

Rather than building the majority of the UNIX commands into the shell the designers choose to provide an easy way of making additional external programs automatically found and launched.  As matter of fact, philosophically, the original idea was to keep the number of builtins as small as possible. \n",

The external programs that one adds to the system can each focus on adding a single new ability.  Eg. A program that lists the contents of a directory to its standard output (`ls`), a program that copies its standard input stream to its standard output stream (`cat`), a program that lists all the current processes (`ps`).  \n",

    "##### Locating  External commands\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to have the shell run an external file as a program:\n",
    "1) by using the pathname of a file as the command\n",
    "2) by using the name of a file that is in on of the directories listed in value of the shell variable called PATH.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Commands as pathnames\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to execute a external command,  indicated by DECISION 1 on the flow chart, is to use the \"path\" name of the file we want to execute as a command.   Recall that [pathname](../unix/files.ipynb#pathname) of a file in UNIX is a name that uses `/`'s to indicate its name withing the tree of existing directories and files.  DECISION 1 is really saying that if the command name of the command line is something that \"looks\" like a path name then assume it is.  In particular ask the kernel to start a new process from the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Absolute and Relative Paths\n",
    "In the prior chapter, [Organizing and Managing Information](../unix/files.ipynb), we discussed how a file is named as a pathname starting at the Root (`/`) of the directory tree.   Such paths whose names begin with `/` are called absolute paths.  \n",
    "To ease the burden of naming files UNIX also provides what are called relative paths.  Rather that starting a path name all the way from the root of the directory tree,  a path can be named relative.  As is discusses in the [Environment](#cwd) section each process has associated with it a \"current working directory\".  We can think of this as a pointer to a specific directory in the directory tree.  When a process asks the kernel to open or lookup a path that does not start with a leading `/` the kernel will assume that the path is relative to the processes current working directory. \n",
    "\n",
    "When we start a new terminal session the shell started has its current working directory initially set to our users HOME directory.  Eg. For the jovyan user in our UNIX environment it would be /home/jovyan.  The `pwd` command can be used to print what the shell's current working directory is and the `cd` command can used to change it to another directory. \n",
    "\n",
    "So if we use, `mydir/myfile`, as a shell command.  The Shell will asked the kernel to locate as an external command.  Given the lack of a leading `/` the kernel will assume that we are looking for a file, `myfile` in a directory called `mydir` which is under the the shell process's current working directory.  If the working directory is `/home/jovyan` then the full path of the file we are trying to locate would be `/home/jovyan/mydir/myfile`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice, however, if our current working directory was `/home/jovyan/mydir` and we wanted to have the shell execute the file `myfile` within it as an external, by pathname, it would not work to simply type `myfile` as the command.  DECISION 1 explicitly states that to treat the command name as a pathname for an external program the command name must contain a `/`.   As it turns out every directory in UNIX contains two hidden directories `.` and `..`.  Where `.` is a short cut for the name of the directory and `..` is a short cut for the name of the parent of the directory.  Using this feature we can construct a name of a file within the current working directory that contains a slash by using `./` as a prefix.  Eg. to trigger the explicit request to execute `myfile` in the current directory as an external command we can use `./myfile`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Details of how path names are decoded can be found in the \"path_resolution\" man page (`man path_resolution`).  \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Commands as files within the PATH list\n",
    "\n",
    "Using pathnames lets us ask the shell to try and execute an file as a process.  However, this does not really make external programs feel like builtin commands.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that there is another path way in the flow chart for reaching STEP B external command execution.  Specifically if the command name is not a user defined function (see [Functions](#functions)),  or a shell builtin command, then the shell will look to see if the command is the name of a file within a set of directories.  The set of directories is the current value of the shell's PATH variable.  Specifically, the PATH variable is treated as a colon separated list of directories to be searched for files that will be launched as external commands.  The list is search from left to right.   If the name of the command matches the name of a file within the directory being searched then the file will be treated as an external command and the shell will attempt to execute it.  Note the first match will terminate the search.  So even if directories later in the path also have a file that matches the command name they will not be considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice three critical points to this design:\n",
    "1. Files within the set of directories do not require use of path names to be executed.  This makes them feel more like built in commands.  Simply adding files to one of the directories listed by the PATH variable is enough to make the program become a \"command\".\n",
    "2. The PATH variable is just an ordinary shell variable that can be updated any time one likes.   You can set it to any values you like.  Thus you can easily add directories of files to it and or remove directories from it. Further remember that every terminal connection has an independent shell process connected to it, each with their own version of the PATH variable.  As such you can override the PATH in one shell process while leaving it untouched in another. \n",
    "3. By controlling the order of directories you can over ride which version of a file should be launched as the command.  In this way you can provide alternative \"personalities\" to the commands by have your own versions in directories that appear before the directories with the standard versions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lets look explore this in a little more detail by examining how the `cat` command gets located.  First lets see if `cat` is a built in by asking for `help` about it."
