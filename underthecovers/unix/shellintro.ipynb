While there are differences between the various Unix shell programs the basic model of interaction we cover in this chapter is largely the same across all of them.   However, with respect to the exact syntax and details we will be focus on the [Bourne Again Shell (BASH)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)),  as it is the default shell for Linux which is the version of Unix we use through out this book.\n",

To access the manual pages you use the `man` program eg. `man man` would bring up the documentation about the manual itself.  So `man bash` will bring up the manual page for the bash shell.  You can find detailed coverage of the syntax and how bash works in the manual.  After we cover some basics it will be much easier to read and understand the Bash manual page as it assumes that you understand some basic Unix and generic shell concepts.  "

    "Remembering that ASCII terminals were the original devices created for humans to interactively work with computers the shell is designed to managed and communicate with a human at a terminal. Thus the human and the shell are really exchanging bytes that encoded information in ASCII.  For every new terminal connection software directs the kernel to start an instance of a shell program  to interact with a user at the terminal.  We consider this the be the start of a shell \"session\".

    "## Line oriented conversation\n",
    "\n",
    "The way we interact with the shell can be thought of as a structured, interactive, \"conversation\". The conversation is a series of back and forth exchanges. We, the user, type in a request in the form of a \"command line\" and in response the shell takes some action and generate a particular response, as byte values, which are sent back to the terminal.  The terminal translates the response as ASCII characters displaying/printing the appropriate images to the screen so we can read it.   \n",
    "\n",
    "### Lines\n",
    "\n",
    "Given our use of ASCII what constitutes a line, in Unix, is very precise. It is a series of byte values terminated by a single 'new-line/line-feed' value.  Using an ASCII  table we see that the byte value for the new-line character is `0b10000010` in binary or expressed more concisely in hex as `0xA`. The common short hand notation for the newline byte value is `\\n`.  Pressing the *return*  or *enter* key, depending on your keyboard, within a terminal window will generate this value.   We will simply refer to the key that generates a '\\n' as the *enter* key.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When `\\n` is received by the shell it will begin working on processing the line as a command.  In this way it is line oriented.  If the user presses `\\n` with no other preceding characters this is considered a blank or empty line.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In the other direction, the terminal emulator is configured to take the appropriate action when it receives a `\\n`.  That is to say it moves the cursor to the next lower position in the window (scrolling if configured to do so) and moves it to the left edge of the new line (again scrolling the window if configured to).\n",

The two modes are character and line.  In character mode the terminal data is sent along to the program running as soon as they are received, including the `\\n`.  In line (or buffered mode) the kernel stores up the characters and sent until it receives a `\\n`.   At which point it sends the complete line with the `\\n` to the program running. The default mode is typically line mode.  For the most part it does not really matter to us as the shell's behavior is largely the same as it is a line oriented program that is designed to process whole lines at a time.  However, later on this can be a source of confusion when we are writing programs that are not line oriented, rather they assume that they will see characters as soon as keys are pressed by the user.  \n",

When a new connection is established it sends the prompt to the terminal so that we know that it is ready for the session/conversation to begin.  The classic prompt string is often one either the dollar symbol, `$` or greater than sign `>` followed by a single space character.  In our illustrations and the default configuration we use set up the prompt to be the classic dollar sign followed by a space.\n",

Where the prompt might state your user name, the date or time, what your current working directory is, etc.   Later when we learn about shell variables we will find out that there is a special variable `PS1` who's value is used to generate the prompt string every time the shell want to send it.  Given that every terminal session/window is connected to separate shells can be very useful to set each one with a unique prompt to help keep you organized eg. `export PS1='Term 1> '`.\n",

You might be wondering why is it that you see the characters you type at the keyboard of terminal appear on the screen of the terminal.  If pressing a key really sends the data to the Unix kernel and then to the program running such as the shell there is not reason we would see it.  Does the Shell send a copy back of what it received?  No it does not.  Rather typically the UNIX kernel is configured, by default, to send back a copy of what it receives on a specific terminal connection back to the terminal itself.  This is setting is called terminal ECHO mode.  So by default even before the Kernel sends data up to the destination program  it sends a copy back to the terminal so that the user can see what they typed.  This includes the `\\n` that the user pressed to indicate the end of the command line.  Hence in this default mode any data send back from the shells behavior will appear on a new-line.  Programs can ask the kernel to disable this setting to have more control of what the users sees.  As a matter of fact like many things in Unix there is a command you can issue to have the kernel adjust the setting for you terminal connect including turning off the echo behavior (`stty -echo` to turn off and `stty echo` to turn back on).  Doing so lets you observe what is really being sent back in response to your command and not what the kernel automatically generated as echo data.  Note things might get confusing quickly if you turn echo off.   But Unix is all about understanding how things work and have the power to control them.  If you want to know more try `man stty` but be warned you will find that communications on a terminal is actually quite a bit more complex than it might seem -- there is a lot of history and skeletons buried here and the kernel is *cooking* the communications quite a bit ;-)"
