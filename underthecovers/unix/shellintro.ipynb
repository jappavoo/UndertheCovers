    "\n",
    "As discussed the core functionality of the Unix operating system is implemented by the Kernel. However, the Kernel does not have any support for humans to directly interact with it. The primary responsibility of the kernel is to provide utilities that simplify the writing and running of application/user programs. This is where the shell comes in. The shell acts as our primary point of contact/interface, not only to the kernel, but also to all other installed programs.\n",

    "The UNIX kernel provides a large set of functions that can be called by a running program.  Remember, on UNIX we call a running program a \"process\". The kernel functions that a process can request are called \"system calls\". In the next part of this book, we will look in more detail at how a process can issue a request for the kernel to execute a system call.  For the moment, it is sufficient to know that each system call, which we identify by names, can only be requested by an already running program. When a process makes a request to execute a system call, it can pass arguments to the system call. Similarly, on completion of the system call the kernel can return values back to the process. Operating system kernels can provide hundreds of system calls. In the diagram to the left, the white labeled boxes within the kernel oval illustrate a small subset of important UNIX kernel system calls. \n",
    "\n",
    "The UNIX kernel, through its system calls, provides the ability for a process to:\n",
    "1. create and manage files and directories,\n",

In other words, a shell has been built to let a human make use of the Operating System kernel, which itself has been written to help us make use of the computer hardware.  It does this by: 1) accepting human oriented commands from a user, 2) executing kernel system calls to get the work of the commands done, and 3) sending a response back.  The shell includes the ability to locate other executable programs and launch new processes from them.    \n",

These interfaces allow us to find and launch programs, open files, and navigate the computer to do our daily work.  The primary goal of such interfaces is ease of use.  The shell, however, is text based, and is designed with programmers in mind.  Specifically, its syntax and commands are designed in such a way that they form an \"extensible\" programming language.  Here, extensible refers to the ability for users to add to and extend it with ease. This language allows a human user to not only use the facilities of the kernel, but also to automate their daily tasks, and efficiently conduct the various forms of data processing programmers often do.

You can find detailed coverage of the functionality and syntax of bash in the manual.

For every new terminal connection, software directs the kernel to start an instance of a shell program to interact with a user at that terminal.

We, the user, type in a request in the form of a \"command line\". In response, the shell takes some actions, and generates a particular response, as byte values, which are sent back to the terminal.

Using an ASCII  table, we see that the byte value for the new-line character is `0b10000010` in binary, or expressed more concisely in hex as `0xA`. The common shorthand notation for the newline byte value is `\\n`.  Pressing the *return*  or *enter* key, depending on your keyboard, within a terminal window will generate this value.

    "There are two basic modes that the UNIX kernel can use when delivering bytes sent from the terminal connection to the program running on the connection; character and line. In character mode, the bytes of data from the terminal are sent along to the running program as soon as they are received, including the `\\n`.  In line (or buffered) mode, the kernel stores up the characters to be sent until a `\\n` is received, at which point it sends the complete line with the `\\n` to the running program. Line mode is typically the default. In the context of our discussion of the shell, this mode setting is not very relevant, as the shell's behavior is largely unchanged by this setting. Since the shell is a line-oriented program, it is designed to process whole lines at a time - regardless of whether the line was recieved in its entirety, or chatacter by character. However, it is good to keep this distinction in mind to avoid confusion when we are writing programs that are not line-oriented, and therefore expect to recieve characters as soon as the keys are pressed by the user.  \n",

The \"prompt string,\" or simply, the \"prompt,\" is the shell's way of visually telling us it is ready to talk. The prompt is a configurable sequence of characters, beginning on a new line, indicating to us that the shell is ready to recieve a line. When a new connection is established, it sends the prompt to the terminal so that we know that it is ready for the session/conversation to begin.  The classic prompt string is often either the dollar symbol, `$` or greater than sign `>` followed by a single space character.  In our illustrations, and in the default configuration we use, the prompt is set to be the classic dollar sign followed by a space.\n",

Given that every terminal session/window is connected to separate shells it can be very useful to set each with a unique prompt to help keep you organized eg. `export PS1='Term 1> '`.\n",

    "When the shell receives a command line it goes through a series of steps to process it.  The rules of this processing define what is called the [Shell Grammar](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/bash.1.html#SHELL_GRAMMAR).  The Shell Grammar and builtin commands form an entire programming language.  Programs written in this language are called Shell Scripts and are used extensively to automate all sorts of tasks.     Over the years one learns more and more subtle aspects and usage of the shell grammar.  While it is possible to use the shell without really knowing its underlying grammar having a working knowledge can really help in understanding why the shell behaves the way it does and its somewhat strange syntax.\n",

    "\n",
    "The two ways we use the shell are either interactively or non-interactive. In either case the core operation of the shell is the same -- process command lines.  The difference is in the interactive mode the commands are coming from a human though a terminal connection versus a file in the non-interactive mode.  In the interactive case after each command line is executed the shell sends the prompt to the human and waits for them to send the next command line.   In non-interactive mode the command lines are being read from a shell script file.  A shell script is a file simply containing several shell command lines. In this mode the command lines in the file are immediately executed one after the other and no prompting or waiting occurs.  \n",

    "### Step 1: Breaking down a \"Command line\" into Simple Commands and Arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "In this step the shell splits the command line up into a set of tokens that form a \"simple commands\".   Several simple commands can make up a single command line. The common boundary that separates tokens are \"blanks\".  Blanks are `space` and `tab` characters ([blanks](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/bash.1.html#DEFINITIONS)).   In the ASCII code, space characters are encoded with a byte value of `0x20` and a tab is encoded by `0x09`.  So a sequence of one more of these two characters will cause the shell to split what is before and after the sequence into to separate tokens.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<a id=\"meta_def\"></a>\n",
    "In addition to the blank `space` and `tab` characters the following characters `|  & ; ( ) < > newline` will also indicate the separation of tokens.  Together, these characters are known as the shell \"metacharacters\".  In time we will learn about how these characters affect the commands to be executed. Some will let us combine simple commands in various ways while others will effect how the command is executed.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Command versus Arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "The first token of simple command is the name of the command to execute.  The following tokens in a set will be passed to the command as arguments.     To know where the arguments of a particular simple command ends the shell looks for one of the following \"control\" operators.  Notice that some of the metacharacters, `| & ; ( )` and `newline` itself both separate tokens and terminate the tokens of simple command.    Using the control characters allow us to chain independent simple commands together. "

Two spaces then separate `hello` from `goodbye`.  Then tghe sequence of space, tab, space separate `goodbye` from `me`.  A single space seperates `me` from `again`.  `again` is terminated as a token by the following space, tab and newline.

Shell variables are actually a special case of a what are called shell parameters. We will focus on variables. The shell provides certain special built in variables such as \"RANDOM\" whose value expands to a random number. As we will see later a very important built is the \"PATH\" variable.  There are several ways we can introduce our own variables and assign them a value.  The simplest is a command line of the form:  `name=value`.   During Parameter Expansion the `$` followed by name will trigger parameter expansion, optionally the name can be enclosed in braces `{name}`.  The token will then be expanded to the value if the named variable exists other wise the token will be simply removed.  The shell provides all kinds of fancy ways of manipulating and transforming the value of a variable during expansions, such as deleting or substituting portions, but we will leave that for later.  Finally shell variables can have attributes associated with them.   One important attribute marks a variable as exported.  We will see later that exported variables are passed to new programs as part of their initial \"environment\".  \n",

Ater the preceeding expansions are done and the second round of word splitting is complete the shell will scan what is left looking for a special set of characters its recognizes as pattern characters.  The most useful of these is the star `*`. The star will be substituted for any sequence of characters.  As such it is often called the wildcard character since it matches anything.  The shell will then look to see if there are files or directories that match the token subtituting the patterns as necessary.  If matching names exist then it will replace the single token with any matches found.

    "### Step 3: Parse Redirections\n",
    "\n",
    "To fully understand what it means to parse redirections we must have a more complete understanding of how commands are run and the UNIX I/O model -- how a program can conduct input and output.    This understanding will take us a little time as it involves concepts such as Processes, Streams and Files and how they inter-relate.  At this point we take a simple view that we will build upon in time.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Processes\n",
    "\n",
    "As we go our understanding of what a process is will become more and more advanced.  For the moment our simple working definition will be a running program other than the kernel.   The shell we interact with is a process and the commands that we run from the shell run within it or as new processes.   We will look at this distinction in more detail when we discuss internal built-in versus external commands.   Regardless the commands we issue run as a process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Parse Redirections step is is all about controlling where the input and out for a process, comes from or goes to.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Streams: Standard Input, Output and Error\n",
    "\n",
    "UNIX provides three default \"streams\" that a process can use for its input and output.  The default streams are called: Standard Input, Standard Output and Standard Error.  A process can ignore these if it wants but most commands by default use these streams.  A stream is a connection to a source or destination for reading or writing bytes.  A process read bytes from a stream via `read` calls to the kernel. Such a stream is an input stream.  Similarly a stream that a process can write bytes to, via `write`  kernel calls, is an output stream.   As implied by the name a stream is like a \"flow\" of bytes.  Reading bytes from an input stream successively gets bytes from the source it is connected to.    Writing bytes to a stream successively sends more and more bytes to the connected destination.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ASCII streams\n",
    "\n",
    "What the bytes \"mean\" or what will be done with them is up to the process. Most of the daily UNIX commands we use assume ASCII line oriented data.  This means that most commands expect that the bytes they read from their standard input will be bytes that encode ASCII lines of data.  Similarly we can expect most commands to write ASCII lines of data to their standard output and error streams.  \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Standard Error\n",
    "\n",
    "The UNIX designers knew that it is very common to have commands produce \"normal\" output and \"error\" output.  To support this separation they decided to make it standard that processes get both, a standard output and error stream.  \n",
    "\n",
    "By convention when UNIX commands are being developed by a programmer they write them to send their \"normal\" output to the standard out stream.    When the programmer of a command wants to send error messages or warning messages they use the standard error stream.  This allows some one using a command to easily direct normal output to one destination and error output to another.   Eg. they might decide they want to ignore and hide all warning messages by redirecting the error stream to a different destination.   While for the most part we don't normally use this extra flexibility there are times when it comes in is very handy.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Streams and Files\n",
    "\n",
    "But where exactly do the bytes for a stream come from or go to?\n",
    "A common phrase that you may hear is that in UNIX everything is a file.  From this perspective streams are connections to files that allow a command to read or write the data of the file.   \n",
    "\n",
    "The designers of UNIX decided that they would try and represent all locations that might serve as a source or destination of data as files.  This includes even devices such as terminals.  To this end the UNIX kernel represents the majority of the devices of a computer as files that a stream can be connected too.   Reading from an input stream connected to a device \"file\" gets data from that device.  Writing to an output stream connected to a device file sends data to the device.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Opening streams and File Descriptors\n",
    "\n",
    "To connect a stream a program makes an \"open\" kernel call.  As part of the open call the program passes the path name of the file to connect the stream to and also specifies if the connection is for input or output (or both).  If successful the kernel will establish the connection.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For every process, running program, the kernel maintains a table of open streams. This table is called a file descriptor table.  Each entry in the table is either empty or not empty.  If empty the entry does not hold a description of an open stream.  If it is not empty then it does contain the information that describes an open stream.  The kernel can then use this descriptor information to operate on the stream, eg. read or write bytes to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "When an open call is made the kernel scans the table for next empty location and then stores the descriptor information about the newly open stream into that location.  The index of this newly populated table entry is returned back to the process.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Historically these indexes are themselves called **File Descriptor** numbers.  All the kernel operations on a stream, such as read and write, require a file descriptor so that the kernel knows what stream to operate on.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The first three  file descriptors; 0, 1, and 2 are the where connections for standard input, output and error are expected to be. \n",
    "\n",
    "```{tip} \n",
    "The UNIX kernel also provides other operations that let's a process control its file descriptors.  This includes the ability to close and and mark one as empty via the `close` system call.  It also lets a process control its table of file descriptors via system calls such as `dup` and `dup2` that duplicate/copy table entries.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Terminals and Streams\n",
    "\n",
    "As we read an ASCII terminal provides a natural way for humans to both receive and send ASCII line oriented data.  When we connect to a UNIX system via a new terminal the kernel starts a shell for us and connects its standard streams to the particular device file that represents our terminal.   When the shell writes bytes such as the prompt to its standard output we see it in the terminal it is \"connected\" too.  Similarly when we type characters into the terminal the shell will receive them when it reads from its standard input.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Defaults\n",
    "\n",
    "When the shell runs a command it establishes what the commands standard input, output and error streams will be connected to.  The default is to connect them to the same streams that the shell is connected to.  In most cases this will be the terminal that the shell is interacting with.    This is the reason the input and output of a command, by default come from and go to the terminal, we are working within.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overriding the defaults\n",
    "\n",
    "Once steps 1 and 2 of command line processing have completed the shell has identified one or more commands along with arguments that we want executed.   In addition to commands and their arguments the shell gives us the ability to control where the input and output streams for a program might come from and go to.\n",
    "    \n",
    "As stated above if we don't use any of the special redirection support then the defaults will be used.   If however we use the redirection syntax then we can have the shell control what file descriptors a command will have open and where they will be connected to before they run.  While there are many advanced uses of the redirection syntax basic usage is straight forward.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "When discussing command line splitting we introduced that `<` and `>` are <a href=\"#meta_def\">metacharacters</a>.  Their primary use is to specify redirections.  The greater than character,  `>`,  is used to control output stream redirection. Conversely, the less than, `<` character is used to control input stream redirection.\n",
    "  \n",
    "The following examples introduce the basics. See the references for details of the syntax and more advanced uses.\n",
    "\n",

    "  \n",
    "#### Redirection Examples\n",
    "    \n",
    "In theses examples we will use  the `date`, `ls`, `cat`,  and `file` commands.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "- The `file` command, tells the \"type\" of the file that we specify as an argument.  We will use it to tell when we a file is a device file versus a regular file. \n",
    "- The `cat` command, by default, if no arguments are specified, reads bytes from the standard input stream and writes them to the standard output stream.  \n",
    "- The `ls` command, as we have seen, lists the contents of the specified directory to standard output.  By default, if no arguments are given then `ls` will list the contents of the current working directory.  \n",
    "- Finally the `date` command, if no arguments are given prints the current date and time to the standard output stream."

    "##### External \"Shell Commands\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps one of the coolest things about the shell, and more generally UNIX, is the way everything is broken down into small building blocks.  Rather than building the majority of the UNIX commands into the shell the designers choose to provide an easy way of making additional external programs automatically found and launched.  As matter of fact, philosophically, the original idea was to keep the number of builtins as small as possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this way the job of the shell stays focused on the syntax for interacting with a human user and the launching of additional commands as processes.  The external programs that one adds to the system can each focus on adding a single new ability.  Eg. A program that lists the contents of a directory to its standard output (`ls`), a program that copies its standard input stream to its standard output stream (`cat`), a program that lists all the current processes (`ps`).  \n",
    "This \"separation of concerns\" not only allows for a great deal of flexibility in adding commands, it also means that one can have several different version of shell programs.  Where each shell version provides its own take on the syntax but they all can reuse the existing commands.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This separation of concerns approach, empowers and encourages programmers:\n",
    "- A programmer can easily grow the system by added a new \"command\"\n",
    "- A programmer can focus each new command she writes on a single task.  \n",
    "- A programmer can easily override the default commands by simply installing their own programs which are found before the standard one\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the years the flexibility of this approach and the popularity of UNIX has lead to the development of a very large set of programs that one can add to the system and treat as commands.  Although they are often referred to as *\"Shell Commands\"* they are not really builtin to an given shell.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Today, when people talk about knowing UNIX commands they, generally are referring to a set of external programs that have evolved into a standard.   The following Wikipedia page documents such a list."

    "##### Locating  External commands\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to have the shell run an external file as a program:\n",
    "1) by using the pathname of a file as the command\n",
    "2) by using the name of a file that is in on of the directories listed in value of the shell variable called PATH.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Commands as pathnames\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to execute a external command,  indicated by DECISION 1 on the flow chart, is to use the \"path\" name of the file we want to execute as a command.   Recall that [pathname](../unix/files.ipynb#pathname) of a file in UNIX is a name that uses `/`'s to indicate its name withing the tree of existing directories and files.  DECISION 1 is really saying that if the command name of the command line is something that \"looks\" like a path name then assume it is.  In particular ask the kernel to start a new process from the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Absolute and Relative Paths\n",
    "In the prior chapter, [Organizing and Managing Information](../unix/files.ipynb), we discussed how a file is named as a pathname starting at the Root (`/`) of the directory tree.   Such paths whose names begin with `/` are called absolute paths.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To ease the burden of naming files UNIX also provides what are called relative paths.  Rather that starting a path name all the way from the root of the directory tree,  a path can be named relative.  As is discusses in the [Environment](#cwd) section each process has associated with it a \"current working directory\".  We can think of this as a pointer to a specific directory in the directory tree.  When a process asks the kernel to open or lookup a path that does not start with a leading `/` the kernel will assume that the path is relative to the processes current working directory. \n",
    "\n",
    "When we start a new terminal session the shell started has its current working directory initially set to our users HOME directory.  Eg. For the jovyan user in our UNIX environment it would be /home/jovyan.  The `pwd` command can be used to print what the shell's current working directory is and the `cd` command can used to change it to another directory. \n",
    "\n",
    "So if we use, `mydir/myfile`, as a shell command.  The Shell will asked the kernel to locate as an external command.  Given the lack of a leading `/` the kernel will assume that we are looking for a file, `myfile` in a directory called `mydir` which is under the the shell process's current working directory.  If the working directory is `/home/jovyan` then the full path of the file we are trying to locate would be `/home/jovyan/mydir/myfile`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice, however, if our current working directory was `/home/jovyan/mydir` and we wanted to have the shell execute the file `myfile` within it as an external, by pathname, it would not work to simply type `myfile` as the command.  DECISION 1 explicitly states that to treat the command name as a pathname for an external program the command name must contain a `/`.   As it turns out every directory in UNIX contains two hidden directories `.` and `..`.  Where `.` is a short cut for the name of the directory and `..` is a short cut for the name of the parent of the directory.  Using this feature we can construct a name of a file within the current working directory that contains a slash by using `./` as a prefix.  Eg. to trigger the explicit request to execute `myfile` in the current directory as an external command we can use `./myfile`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Details of how path names are decoded can be found in the \"path_resolution\" man page (`man path_resolution`).  \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Commands as files within the PATH list\n",
    "\n",
    "Using pathnames lets us ask the shell to try and execute an file as a process.  However, this does not really make external programs feel like builtin commands.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that there is another path way in the flow chart for reaching STEP B external command execution.  Specifically if the command name is not a user defined function (see [Functions](#functions)),  or a shell builtin command, then the shell will look to see if the command is the name of a file within a set of directories.  The set of directories is the current value of the shell's PATH variable.  Specifically, the PATH variable is treated as a colon separated list of directories to be searched for files that will be launched as external commands.  The list is search from left to right.   If the name of the command matches the name of a file within the directory being searched then the file will be treated as an external command and the shell will attempt to execute it.  Note the first match will terminate the search.  So even if directories later in the path also have a file that matches the command name they will not be considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice three critical points to this design:\n",
    "1. Files within the set of directories do not require use of path names to be executed.  This makes them feel more like built in commands.  Simply adding files to one of the directories listed by the PATH variable is enough to make the program become a \"command\".\n",
    "2. The PATH variable is just an ordinary shell variable that can be updated any time one likes.   You can set it to any values you like.  Thus you can easily add directories of files to it and or remove directories from it. Further remember that every terminal connection has an independent shell process connected to it, each with their own version of the PATH variable.  As such you can override the PATH in one shell process while leaving it untouched in another. \n",
    "3. By controlling the order of directories you can over ride which version of a file should be launched as the command.  In this way you can provide alternative \"personalities\" to the commands by have your own versions in directories that appear before the directories with the standard versions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lets look explore this in a little more detail by examining how the `cat` command gets located.  First lets see if `cat` is a built in by asking for `help` about it."

    "Further we said that each has its own \"life-time\" -- it gets started and then can run for some arbitrary amount of time, and them terminate eg. exit.  This is the common model that we have all grown use to as the idea of a running \"App\" either on our phones or laptops.  \n",
    "\n",
    "On UNIX a running App is a Process.  Remember that on UNIX a shell process is automatically started for us when we opened a terminal connection.  While it might feel quite different, the way we start a running App across operating systems and the relationship between them is similar.  An initial App, that we as humans interact with, lets us start other Apps.   So on UNIX a shell process lets us start other processes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "*Parents and Children Processes:* On UNIX processes are organized as a tree.  Processes started by one process are called children of the starting process.  Similarly the process that started a particular process is its parent.  Parent processes get certain control of their children processes.    We will discuss this in more detail in the next chapter.  For the moment this should be good enough for us to understand this critical step in command line processing. \n",
    "% What exactly is the relationship and mechanisms that the Shell uses to run particular files as external commands. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Binary Executables:*  We have been some what vague about what makes a file a \"program\" from which a running App can be started.   Every operating system has a very particular file format, the way the information  of a file is encoded in bytes, that makes it possible for the operating system kernel to start new running Apps from it.    Such files go by several generic names, \"executables\" and \"binaries\" are common ones.   Much of the next Part of this book is about understanding exactly what a binary executable is and how to construct one.  For the moment it is sufficient for us to know that many of the files in the directories, within our path, are properly formatted  UNIX binaries.  This means that the UNIX kernel can start processes from them.  The binary executable format use by the LINUX kernel is called \"Executable and Linkable Format (ELF)\".  So binary executables on Linux are \"ELF files\". \n",

    "Lets recall where we are in the flow of Processing a Command Line.  We are at [Step 4: Execute the Command, Sub-step B: request kernel to execute as external command](#fig:executionsteps).   The figures to the left illustrate a break down of what happens in this sub-step.  At the start we know the file that corresponds to the external command, the arguments to be passed to it, and any re-directions that need to be established for the process that will be created.  In the example the file is \"/usr/bin/ls\", a single argument is being passed to it `/etc` and finally no re-directions have been specified.  Given the lack of re-directions we expect the standard streams of the new process to be connected to the same places that the launch `bash` process standard streams are connected to. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the example illustrated, we see that initially we have our `bash` process which has its standard streams connected to an external terminal.  This is represented by the thick red arrow that connects the process through to the communication hardware to the outside world. In the next chapter when we visualize files within the kernel we will be more detailed on how the kernel enables this connection.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The core functionality, of this step is illustrated in the middle sub-figure.  The `bash` process on our behalf makes use two kernel system calls; 1) fork, and 2) exec.  At this point the details of these calls are not particularly important.  What matters is that the shell passes to the `exec` system call the path of the file to be executed, along with the list of arguments and a copy of the 'exported' shell variables.  \n",
    "We will say more about the 'exported' shell variables when we discuss the [execution environment](#sec:env).\n",
    "\n",
    "When the sequence of calls complete a new child process, of the `bash` process will be started from the file specified.  In this case `/usr/bin/ls`.  Now, as illustrated in the third and final bottom sub-figure, two processes exist; the original parent `bash` process, and a new child `ls` process.   This new child process will have a copy of the arguments and environment variables that were passed to the `exec` system call.  By default its standard streams will be connected to the same locations that its parent  process's streams were  connected to when it started the child.  In our example this is illustrated by the two red thick, dashed  arrows, going to the same external connection (eg. the same external terminal).\n",

    "At this point, the new `ls` process is an running independently of its parent `bash`.  "

    "The synchronous behavior is illustrated in our example to the right.  We see that, after launching the child process for `ls` the shell calls one of the `wait` system calls.  The kernel pauses, \"blocks\", the shell process at this point.  This means that the shell will not execute any more of its steps until the kernel decides to un-pause it. In the mean time the child `ls` process can execute steps of its program which will use kernel calls to examine the directory `/etc` and print a summary of its contents to its standard output stream.  Given that in our case, no redirections where specified, the output will go to the same terminal that it's parent `bash` is connected too.  When the `ls` program is complete and exits, a call to the kernel's `exit` system call will be made.  The kernel will recognize that the `bash` process was blocked waiting the its child process to exit and un-pause the `bash` process.  As part of this un-pausing the kernel will let the call `bash` made to the `wait` system call will return.  \n",

So right after the current command exits we can use the `?` variable to access the exit status of the command.  Given how the variable expansion works we can view the value by using the expansion syntax of `$?`.  For example"

Our goal was to have the shell get to step B of the [flow chart of command line processing](#fig:executesteps) and have the kernel successfully start it as a new process so that decision 5 would result in a No and the shell would proceed to step 5 of command line processing.  To trigger this path way we needed to make sure the kernel would on its own be able to identify the file as a script.  \n",

    "The kernel has a automatic behavior for recognizing files that should be treated as commands to be interpreted by another binary program such as `bash` or `python`.   We will be discussing what exactly a `binary` program is later.  Regardless, if the file asked to be launched is marked as executable but not a binary the kernel will examine the beginning of the file.  If it finds the pattern `#!<path>` it will try starting the specified  <path> as a process passing in the original file as its first argument.  \n",

    "In our `cat` example the kernel examines the file to start a new process.  The file is not a binary, rather it is just a file of ascii lines.   As such it will examine it and find the  first line and realizes that it must launch the specified `binary` and pass the original file as the first argument.  In this case `/bin/bash` passing `/home/jovyan/mybin/cat` as it's first argument.  So in our case, it turns out to be the equivalent to: `/bin/bash /home/jovyan/mybin/cat`.   Conveniently, when the new `bash` process starts and reads the first line it will ignore it as it starts with a `#` and be treated a comment.  This is why so many interpreted languages use `#` as their comment character.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second case of `myscript` we manually started a new bash process and passed the `myscript` file as its argument, eg: `bash myscript` So we did not need the kernels help.  Rather we started the new `bash` process and told it to read the file as a **shell script**.\n",

    "Notice the shell command line execution steps does provide us a way to have `myscript` started as an external shell script command with out adding the first line.    Examine the [flow chart of command line processing](#fig:executesteps), and look at step `D`.  If the kernel fails to be able to start a new process from the specified file the behavior of step `D` is to start a new shell process passing the specified file as a script to it.   So the default behavior is that any non-binary file that is marked as executable will be treated as a **shell script**.
