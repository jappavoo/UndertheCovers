Programmers use Operating Systems, and other software tools to create new programs themselves.

Some are designed for special purpose computers and the programs that are expected to run on them like computers built into an airplane to control its various parts or a super-computer which is expected to run complex and large scientific simulation programs.  While other operating systems are designed primarily to enable users to install and run commercial grade programs on their personal devices.  These operating systems while they do enable programmers to write new programs, they are designed to hide most of these aspects from their \"normal\" target user.  Those users mainly just wants to use programs written by others.  The interface of these operating systems tend to focus on graphics and visually oriented ways of interacting with programs.\n",

It is the core software that is used to manage the various devices of the computer and construct an environment that allows programmers to create new users programs.  The idea is that very little is really built into UNIX rather its users are encouraged to write lots of small programs that build on the functionality of the kernel to do useful things.  The kernel's main job is to provide the ability to run new program, provide those programs with access to the hardware, and provide common ways for programs to interconnect, work together.   \n",

    "### The Kernel\n",
    "\n",
    "The Kernel is the bottom layer of software that has direct access to all the hardware.  There is a single instance of the kernel that bootstraps the hardware.  It provides a means for starting application programs (often also called user programs).  The kernel performs and provides several important abilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The kernel enables several user programs to run at the same time.\n",
    "2. The kernel keeps each running user program isolated from each other -- such that each program can behave as if it is the only program running.\n",
    "3. The kernel provides facilities for managing the running programs, eg. listing, pausing, terminating, etc.\n",
    "4. While user programs can be started and can end the kernel is always present and running.  If it ends it means the your computer has crashed!\n",
    "5. The kernel provides a collection of ever present functions and objects that programs/programmers can rely on:\n",
    "    - it provides core \"software\" \"abstractions\" packaged in the form of a library of kernel functions\n",
    "        - these functions make it easier for programs to use the hardware\n",
    "        - the kernel ensures that these functions,  behaves consistently across different hardware\n",
    "    - these functions hides the details and complexity of the hardware devices from the programs and thus the programmers who wrote them.  For example a Unix kernel provides programs with the generic abstraction of a [\"file\"](../unix/files.ipynb) that allows programs to create, store and recall data on storage devices without ever needing to know any details of the devices themselves. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img style=\"margin: 10px 0px 0px 0px;\" align=\"left\" width=\"60\" src=\"../images/warning.svg\"> A critical point of the Unix design: **Humans do not and cannot directly interact with the kernel, only User Programs can interact with the kernel by invoking kernel functions**.  This design promotes and encourages that the rest of the operating systems and for that matter all other software be viewed as separated from the kernel.  As such it encourages a building block approach where several alternatives for any given OS feature, like human interface programs, can be added, supported and explored while the kernel remains without change.  The goal is to empower programmers to grow and extend the system in a natural and seamless way. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is worth noting most modern operating systems have adopted this basic organization where there is a base kernel component and a large collection of pre-packaged user programs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='UnixUser_sec'></a>\n",
    "### User Programs \n",
    "\n",
    "Largely what most people think of when they think of an OS is the large body of pre-packaged user programs that can be installed with the kernel of the OS.   Typically there are at least three categories of user programs, including:\n",
    "1. Display Servers:  These are collections of programs designed to operate specific devices for human interaction such as graphical screens, keyboards, mice, touch pads, touch screens, etc.  The first layer of this software (after the kernel) is typically some form of [Windowing System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windowing_system#Display_server).  Examples include Microsoft's [Desktop Window Manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_Window_Manager), Apple's [Quartz Compositor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartz_Compositor) and the [X Window System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System) traditionally used by Unix operating systems. Today we are also seeing the rise of using web-browsers to present a graphical interface system this includes [Jupyter Lab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Jupyter#JupyterLab) which we make use of.   However, as in the case of Unix, older systems they typically retain support for their rich older [ASCII terminal devices](../unix/terminal.ipynb) in the form of command line shell programs ([Shell](../unix/shellintro.ipynb)). \n",
    "2. [File Managers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_manager):  Programs that work with a Display Server and provide a human the ability to explore and find information about the other programs and data installed.  Examples include Apple's [Finder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finder_(software)) and Microsoft's [File Manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Manager_(Windows)).\n",
    "3. Other: There is a highly variable collection of software that form the rest of the user programs.  This body largely depending on the OS and its intended target audience.   In the case of OS's that are geared to personal computers this set of software includes:  media programs, web-browsers, productivity applications and more.  While not always standard, the tools for developing new programs also fall in this category.   These include program editors, programming languages and debuggers.  A hallmark of Unix is the rich body of programming tools associated with it (including the tools to rebuild the kernel itself).    \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the distinguishing feature of Unix is its standard user command line programs that are geared to programmers (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unix_commands).  While they lack graphical interfaces and are [ASCII](../unix/terminal.ipynb#ASCII_sec)/command line oriented they form a very rich and powerful set of building blocks that allow a knowledgeable programmer to rapidly create turnkey solutions including the; text searching and transformation, data wrangling, automation, as well as the development and debugging of large applications.

    "\n",
    "UNIX's terminal interface and program development environment became the gold standard for university Computer Science education.  The following are some of the reasons it became so and why it continues to be critical both academically, scientifically and industrially. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most basic interface it presents, the [Shell](../unix/shellintro.ipynb), is a programmer oriented model for interacting with the computer.  Furthermore Unix comes with a large collection of composable and extensible tools for processing ASCII documents that naturally integrate and extend the power of the Shell.  These tools make it easy to write new programs including programs that translate ASCII documents, source code in one language, into source code of another language.\n",
    "\n",
    "While it takes some effort to learn its strange command line interface, doing so teaches you to think like a programmer.  Where you are encouraged to writing little re-usable programs that you incrementally evolve as needed and combine with others to get big tasks done.  Generally trying to avoid any particular program from getting too complicated.  \n",
    "\n",
    "UNIX also does is not prescriptive on how you should do things.  Rather it provides a large collection of simple building blocks that you can learn to creatively use to meet your needs.  The investment in learning its building blocks and models for composing them minimizes time and effort in going from an idea to a prototype.  UNIX's programming oriented nature leads to an environment in which almost anything about the OS and user experience can be customized and programmed.  UNIX makes automation the name of the game -- largely everything you can do manually can be turned into a program that automates the task. \n",
    "\n",
    "UNIX has instilled in generations of computer scientists a basic aesthetic for how to design and structure complicated collections of software.  In particular one learns that the designers of UNIX tried to structure the system around a small core set of ideas, \"abstractions\", that once understood allows a programmer to understand the rest of the system and how to get things done.   In UNIX this set includes: Files, Processes, I/O redirection, Users and Groups.  All of which we will cover late in this book.  \n",
    "\n",
    "UNIX's programming friendly nature has lead to the development of a very large and rich body of existing software for UNIX.    With contributions coming from researchers, industry, students and hobbyists  alike.  This body of software has come to be a large scale shared human repository that we rely on heavily.  The computer servers that form the core of the Internet and the Cloud largely run a UNIX variant called Linux.  Many of the computers embedded in the devices that surround us from wifi routers, medical devices, automobiles, and everything else also often run a version of Linux.  But perhaps most critically UNIX, in the form of Linux, is a corner stone of the Open Source software ecosystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bottomline\n",
    "\n",
    "UNIX comes with the kernel and a large collection of existing programs that permit a programmer to write more programs, that they and others can use.   In this book we will focus on what a program really is, how they are constructed and along the way the core tools, skills and ideas that underly all of computing.  Given UNIX's programmer focus and transparency it is a good choice for us. Furthermore, learning how to be productive in the UNIX environment will teach us a lot about being productive programmers period.\n",
