    "\n",
    "1. Very poor and inconsistent performance on operate-first\n",

    "2. nootbook output cells data is painful in git consider other options:\n",
    "    - In some sense this is what Juptext is supposed to help with .... but I could not figure out the right way to get jupyter-book to recongnize Juptext markdown documents to be executable and hence they did not have the launch icon generated for them.\n",
    "    - in the end I have settled on using [nbstripout](https://github.com/kynan/nbstripout) ... container has a default install of it configured for all users ... see `/etc/gitconfig` \n",
    "3. Docker Image is very large\n",
    "    - have not been worried about size\n",
    "        - broken down into 3 docker stages:\n",

    "                    - includes a build of a recent version of gdb as distros don't seem to include one yet\n",
    "            2. base-unmin\n",
    "                - From base (above)\n",
    "                    - invokes unminize command so that user experience is more like a full blown system.  Eg manpages and other doc are present\n",
    "            3. bu-cs-book-dev\n",
    "                - From base-unmin\n",
    "                    - adds all the extra python packages for the jupyter-book and rise stuff I depend on for UC:SLS\n",
    "                    - adds custom startup scripts so that starting on MOC/operate-first behaves correctly\n",

    "```\n",
    "The startup logic of the container which we inherited from the jupyter/minimal-notebook:latest (https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks/blob/master/base-notebook/start.sh) does a bunch magic:\n",
    "  - when spawned by the main jupyterhub server on oprate-first the container seems to launch with a userid of the operate-first uesr (eg in my case 1000950000) and a gid of root (0)\n",
    "  - which does not match the uid of the joyvan user in the container (1000) so the startup script replaces the joyvan user with a new joyvan user who's uid is the operate-first user id.  \n",
    "  - however it does nothing to the permissions of the homedir and it seems to let the gid of root persist\n",
    "  - so by default the home directory is readable but can not be written\n",
    "  - to fix this I modify the container's base permission of the joyvan homedir to be group 0\n",
    "  - oddly enough this all seems to work\n",
    "4. Oddly enough this also seems to solve my problem of persistent state:  The default logic is starting the jupyter server in the joyvan home dir which is not on the volume mounted by operate-first and its contents is server instance specific.  Destroying the server (stopping it) and restarting seeds the joyvan home dir back to its initial state from the container\n",
    "5. To access the api we must have the api token this however is not present in the same way as it was when running the jupyter notebook server locally -- see ln_preamble.py:<br>\n",
    "   on operate-first jupyerhub the api token is in an environment variable\n",
    "6. To make get requests we must use a full url to the localhost introduced localhost_url in ln_preamble\n",
    "7. To access the users server urls we need to prefix with `/hub/user-redirect` or any equivalent eg. to get access terminal 3 it would be `/hub/user-redirect`.  So now to embed a terminal we would can succesfully do the following: <br>\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "IFrame('/hub/user-redirect/terminals/2', 1400, 600)\n",
    "```\n",
    "or\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "IFrame('/user/jappavoo@bu.edu/terminals/2', 1400, 600)\n",
    "```\n",
    "or\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "IFrame('/hub/user/jappavoo@bu.edu/terminals/2', 1400, 600)\n",
    "```\n",
    "which means that we can use base_url as reported by server info in both environments to embedded a terminal\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "IFrame(base_url + 'terminals/2', 1400, 600)\n",
    "```\n",
    "The above now lets us embed terminals in the notebooks similar to the functionality of running a locally hosted version of the container and starting the jupyter notebook server by hand (see make devnb).  Have rewriten python/ln_preamble.py appropriately.\n",
    "8. Had a very hard time with getting python package installed and configure in a way that worked on opf with all constraints meet.  The current head of the bu-cs-book-dev repo has the version that I found to work:  \n",
    "    - boots on opf (from some reason prior commit in which I very carefully tested python package commands fails to boot).  \n",
    "    - all jupyter notebook extensions that I want installed by default work and are on when user opens a notebook\n",
    "    - the right version of jupyter books is installed -- use of conda got the wrong version switch to using pip install and this got the right version\n",
